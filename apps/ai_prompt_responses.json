like where you actually want to go in life it's really important that you get a very strong sense of where you are right now so imagine you're in a forest and maybe you're lost in this Forest there are kind of three things that you need to do to become unstuck and to get not lost in the forest step one is that you kind of need to know where you're going step two is that you need to know where you are right now and step three is that you need to figure out your path to get from where you are right now to where you want to be and now you won't be lost in that forest and then you won't be lost in life anymore and to help address all of this stuff this is episode 2 in a little minseries that we're doing here on the channel about how to figure out what you really want and in episode number one which will be linked up there and in the video description we try to figure out what is our North Star like based on what we want our future to look like where is that destination what direction are we broadly trying to go in and now in this video we're going to figure out where we are right now and we're also going to be looking back at our past and our present to help get the sense of how to figure out what we really want we are trying trying to tackle some very big questions here that can get very big and very heavy but the key thing is to not let ourselves get discouraged by the fact that we're trying to answer these big questions really what we're trying to do is act as adventurers we're on this little Adventure through life and we're just trying to figure out you know where are we right now and what is the compass telling us about where we kind of want to be and we don't need to overthink it it's so easy to overthink this stuff but what I would encourage you to do is just give it a go and I guarantee if you just give it a go and think about the things and maybe even write them down you'll get a little bit more clarity on what you actually want which is part of the point of the series all right so let's start with part one of this video which is taking stock of where we are right now and the first prompt that we can consider here is fairly simple it's when it comes to work right now what's working and what's not working and I'd love for you to pause the video right now and think about the answer to the question when it comes to your work what's working and what's not working and do consider writing down your answers writing things down gives Clarity in a way that just thinking about this stuff really doesn't and so if I rewind if few years and if I were asking myself when it comes to my work what's working and what's not working right now I'm a foundation year 2 doctor I'm working In Obstetrics and Gynecology in West suffk Hospital in beron Edmonds and I would say what's working is the fact that it's pretty fun assisting in emergency cesarian sections I really enjoy seeing patients on my own and I love being able to make a management plan and then running it past a senior so that they can check my work and make sure I'm doing things in a reasonable fashion I also love the fact that especially in the evenings I'm able to have enough time on the side to be able to Tinker away with some YouTube video scripts and work on my business and stuff when it's a little bit quiet what's not working is the fact that I don't really look forward to going in I get the Sunday night scaries when it's Monday the next morning it's an hour long drive to go to work and also back again and I quite enjoy the drives because I listen to fantasy fiction audiobooks usually by Brandon Sanderson on the way but then when I get to work I'm like oh I just want to keep on listening to this Audi book I don't want to actually go in once I'm in it's it's pretty reasonable but there are a few colleagues that I don't really get on with one in particular and I also have a sense of like I don't really know where this career is taking me because I feel like I don't have a sense of where I actually want my medical career to go just yet so it sort of feels like I'm on a bit of a hamster wheel just waiting for this year of being a foundation your doctor to end so that I can then like make a decision about what I really want and I feel like my life is being run by a rotor coordinator rather than that I'm in control of my own life I'm just telling you what my answers would have been just to give you a sense of like this is the sort of thing that we're trying to get at and then we can do exactly the same thing for our life so when it comes to my life what's working and what's it's not working and if you need a bit of a prompt life is usually mostly personal health and relationships those tend to be the things that make up life although some people would say that play or joy is part of life or like growth is part of life you know what life means to you so I'd encourage you to pause the video right now if you haven't already and think about the answer to that question for yourself and maybe even write it down now based on just those two questions right now you should already have a reasonable sense of where you are in life right now which is useful for figuring out what you want but another more specific way of assessing where you are in life is something called called The Wheel of Life exercise I've mentioned this in my book Feelgood productivity which is just become a New York Times and suunday Times bestseller so thank you everyone for your support on that and I also mentioned it in a couple of the previous videos so if you've done this exercise already you don't need to do it again but this is the exercise for those of you who haven't come across it before you're going to start by for example drawing a circle on a page and you split it up into three components work health and relationships now within each of these three components you split them up into another three components So within health for example I would say body mind and soul relationships I would categorize into romance family and friends and work I would categorize into Mission money and growth and then I would add a final category which is outside of the wheel and I would call it Joy The Joy category now these are sort of 10 different areas of life and the idea of The Wheel of Life exercise is that you rate yourself from a scale of 0 to 10 how aligned do you feel in this area of your life or how satisfied am I with the progress I'm making in this area of my life so for example if you want to be a billionaire and you're not yet a billion but you're like taking steps to get there you might rate yourself quite high on the money front even if you're not a billionaire yet if you get what I mean so this diagram is going to be on screen and I would suggest you pause the video and just think what are your answers to these 10 different prompts now I'm just going to run you through my scores for whatever it's worth right now I would give physical health or body a 9 out of 10 because I've just signed up to a personal trainer and I've hit the gym very frequently in the last couple of weeks the Mind category I would say is out of 10 and the Soul category I would probably say is like a four in terms of relationships romance is probably a nine family is probably a s 11 friends is probably a five and in terms of the work category mission is nine money is 10 and growth I would say is probably a six and in the joy category I would say Joy is probably a 6 out of 10 and often that's all it takes to do this exercise sometimes I just think about it if I'm like waiting in line somewhere or if I'm on the toilet I'll just think hm what are my Wheel of Life scores and then I'll just run through the categories and think about the numbers and then usually once I've thought about the numbers I'll identify a clear area where I'm like ooh that's an area that I want to work on on so as I just did this exercise live I realized ooh my friends category is only like a five out of 10 yeah it's cuz I haven't actually seen some friends in a while and I'm actually in London for the next month so I should probably just reach out to a bunch of people and be like hey do you want to hang out which is not what I'm going to do Straight Out filming this video see we've already made progress on things that matter to us just by virtue of doing the self-reflection exercise and if you can't be bothered to do The Wheel of Life by yourself that's also totally fine we actually have an online quiz version of The Wheel of Life you can click down in the video description it's completely free you can take the quiz and it will give you a nicely designed Wheel of Life that you can then like print out or screenshot into whatever software you want now whenever I do this exercise with people in real life there are always some people in the audience and this might be you who rate themselves very low and if you're rating yourself very low across all areas of life then I suspect you're the kind of person who's probably a little bit harsh to yourself you're probably pretty kind to your friends or family you're probably pretty critical of yourself so that's just one thing to say it's like you know let's not be too pessimistic about these different scores it's important to really look for positive evidence here like if you have rated everything a zero I highly highly doubt that every single thing in your life is a zero so if even some of the categories are anything above zero what you can do is ask yourself what is it that makes this category a three rather than a zero what am I giving myself points for and then you can ask yourself okay what would it take to get it to a four what would it take to get it to a five we're not shooting for 10 out of 10 here we're just shooting for a little marginal Improvement because often figuring out what we want is about figuring out what are the marginal improvements I want to make in this era of my life if for example you're only making a few hundred a month and you would like to be making hundreds of thousands of dollars a month and that might be your 10 out of 10 let's not shoot for that right now let's just go from like you know what would it take for me to I don't know increase my income by 10% or 20% you know things like that and you know there is that phrase It's Not About The Pursuit of Happiness it's about the happiness of pursuit we should concern ourselves not so much with the pursuit of happiness but with the happiness of pursue like pursuing something and feeling ourselves making progress towards a goal that we've set for ourselves is profoundly motivating so if you're feeling demotivated by the exercise taking action and actually moving forwards in some of these areas that you want to work on will I promise improve your motivation Absolut by by by an absolutely huge amount now once you've done this Wheel of Life exercise if you realize that your growth category is a little bit suboptimal then you might like to check out the sponsor of this video which is skillshare if you haven't heard if You' have somehow been living under a rock and haven't heard about skillshare I'll tell you about it skillshare is an amazing online platform that has on online classes in all sorts of subjects from video editing and productivity to cooking interior design like career skills like almost anything you could want to learn is there as online classes on skillshare now I've personally been teaching on skillshare since 2019 my goodness it's been a while and I've got around 10 classes on skillshare some of them are about video editing we've got classes about productivity we've got classes on how to use notion and so if you're interested in growing in those particular areas you might like to check out some of my classes on skillshare but you can also check out a bunch of other classes as well now one of the things about skillshare is that there's just so much stuff on there it can sometimes be a bit overwhelming knowing where to start which is why the skillshare learning paths are particularly effective and the idea of these learning paths is that they're a curated set of classes with resources that allow you to go from beginner to Pro as efficiently as possible now I've got my own personal learning path to productivities so if you want to be more productive in any area of your life you might like to go through that but there are also other really good learning paths on skillshare like for example if you're interested in growing a creative business or a side hustle there's an amazing learning path that has six different classes with over 7 hours of content so you can get a reasonable overview of the foundations of how to build your own side hustle or your own creative business this focuses on brainstorming your business and defining your brand and your audience and how to Market yourself online it's super comprehensive and I really wish I'd had a resource like this when I first started out in business like 15 years ago CU it would have saved me so much time with all

decide if it's for you or not so thank you so much to skillshare for sponsoring this video and let's get back to it and now we come to the final exercise of part one of this video which is about figuring out where we are and this is the truths exercise now to explain this exercise I want to show a clip from a podcast interview that I did with my friend and business coach Robin weight and this was filmed about 7 months ago list off 10 things that you know are true about you right now yeah right now okay 10 Things I know are true about me y are we talking I mean like anything life business male I'm 5' 11 and a half but I go by 6'1 on hinge obviously um um I enjoy playing video games though I don't make much time for it I enjoy reading books I have a YouTube channel I uh have a podcast I went to medical school I vaguely enjoyed working as a doctor I uh used to play chess and would like to get more into it I like playing the guitar I love musical theater and and Taylor Swift um I'd like to release an album of songs one day cool I think that's about 10 uh and you could probably come up with a hundred different things a thousand different things which you know to be true about you and the thing is nobody can take those away so you saw here what I did like it felt a bit uncomfortable initially but I was I was like whoa like what do you mean but then I listed a bunch of these truths about myself and we actually got a bunch of different people in our team to do this as well and this is a really valuable exercise you know there's that phrase you can't read the label from inside the bottle often you know we're inside the bottle of our own lives it's very hard for us to see the label that on that bottle and it's so easy for us to think of ourselves as like oh I'm not making progress I'm not doing this I'm not doing that but by listing out these truths about ourselves things that we know to be true it actually often gives us a sense of oh yeah that is who I am that is how far I've come that is what I'm doing and you know I do have these friends and I do have this family and this is what I do for work and this is what I do for fun the other thing is that you want these to be positive statements please do not write negative statements about yourself think about what you do have and who you are rather than what you don't have and who you are not and we're going to do part two of this exercise in part two of this video and hopefully you'll see how these truths become relevant as part of figuring out what we really want all righty let's move on to part two of the video which is how to actually know what you want and we're going to use a little technique here which is about looking backwards in order to look forwards now before we go there I want to say there is one major mistake that a lot of people make when it comes to thinking about what they really want and that's the idea of mimetic Desire now this is a theory that a philosopher called Renee Girard came up with like a few decades ago and there's a really good book about it it's called wanting by Luke Burgess and this book is all about kind of why we want the things that we think we want and basically to cut a long story short mimetic desire is the idea that the things that we want are often not shaped by some sort of internal sense of self some internal authenticity the things that we want are often shaped by what people around us want if a friend or a neighbor has bought a Tesla Model 3 you're going to be much more likely to spontaneously decide that you also want want a Tesla Model 3 if a friend has got a promotion you're going to think oh I should be getting that promotion now there's no getting around the fact that like you know we live in society and humans are social creatures and so there's naturally going to be an element of Mimis in basically everything we do but there are a few different strategies that we can use to make sure the things we're working towards are actually authentic to us and Method number one for this is fulfillment stories and the prompt is to think about or write about a time in your life when you did something well and it brought you a sense of fulfillment when in your life did you do something well that brought you a sense of fulfillment now a fulfillment story needs to have these three things and here I'm going to read some highlights from the book wanting by Luke Burgess number one it's an action you took some concrete action and you were the main protagonist as opposed to passively taking in an experience as life-changing as a Springsteen concert at The Stone Pony might have been for you it's not a fulfillment story it might be for Bruce but not for you dedicating yourself to learning everything about an artist and their work on the other hand could be second you believe you did well you did it with Excellence you did it well by your own estimation and nobody else's you are looking for an achievement that matters to you if you grilled what you think is a perfect riby Stak the other night then you did something well and achieved something don't worry about how big or small the achievement might seem to anyone else and number three it brought you a sense of fulfillment your action brought you a deep sense of fulfillment maybe even Joy not the fleeting temporary kind like an endorphin rush fulfillment you woke up the next morning and you felt a sense of satisfaction about it you still do just thinking about it bring some of it back and the idea here is that you want to identify 3 to five or more potentially fulfillment stories from your life where you did something you did it well and it brought you a sense of fulfillment and this gives you a sense of what you actually want but in a way that's probably distinct from what Society is telling you now when I think about these fulfillment stories one of the most Salient ones that comes to my mind just to give you an example is when I was the director of the medical school pantomime in my fifth year of medical school this was a pantomime that we put together whereas I was directing it with a friend his name is will it was great amazing experience we got like a hundred different medical students together from all year groups and we produced to this pantomim that was a bit of like a a sort of a parody of Hercules with a bunch of like medical songs and stuff it was absolutely sick I guess you had to be there but one of the things I still remember this was this was years ago this was like seven years ago it still almost brings a tear to my eye when I think about it to this day because we were all working together to produce this thing that was greater than we were as individuals and so it was it was this combination of like teamwork and togetherness for the sake of something greater you know we didn't make any money from it like that wasn't the goal no one was being paid to do any of this stuff pure voluntary effort where I also felt like I was leveling up and learning something the fact that that is one of my fulfillment stories gives me a sense of H maybe I want more of those sorts of experiences where I'm leveling up where I'm working with people where we're working towards something that's bigger than any of us are individually that's pretty freaking cool all righty method number two now for for figuring out what you want is by doing an energy audit so the idea here is that you look back on your calendar or the activities that you've done in the last let's say 2 weeks and you want to figure out which were the ones that gave you energy and which were the ones that drained your energy now if you're looking at your calendar you might adjust the calendar event like if it gave you a lot of energy you put a plus or a double plus by the thing and that will that's a sign that it gave you energy if it drained your energy you put a minus or a minus minus or a plus minus if it was like a little bit neutral I think this exercise is from Grace Len's book called think big but the guys who wrote the book designing your life also have a similar one which they call the good time Journal where you wrate your energy and engagement in the in each of these different activities so what I would suggest is that you pause the video right now if you would please and just think about what are some things that you did in the last week that gave you energy and what are some things that you did that really drained your energy that'll give you a bit more of a sense of trying to figure out what you really want now this energy order is particularly important when it comes to work because if you can find the things related to work that give you energy that gives you a pretty reasonable sense of what kind of work you actually want to do for example I find for myself tinkering away on a website landing page and doing website design and development gives me a lot of energy for some weird reason and that's probably why I've been tinkering away with websites for the last 15 16 17 nearly years of my life my goodness I'm old but for me doing very detail oriented work and looking through spreadsheets and data and stuff that tends to drain my energy rather than give me energy whereas there are people on my team there are friends of mine who freaking love a spreadsheet they love being in in the weeds with the data and that lights them up and that is amazing that there are people like that out there actually interestingly on that note at various points in my life I've thought you know what I should get back into playing video games cuz I used to love playing World of Warcraft back in the day I used to be so addicted to it and earlier this year I was like you know started playing B gate I was playing Hogwarts Legacy last year and I would always do a little bit of an energy audit after a while and I would ask myself does sitting down and playing video games give me energy or does it drain my energy and annoyingly it drains my energy a lot of the time and that's kind of annoying cuz I'm like oh maybe actually this whole like I want to play more video games is actually just me clinging to an identity that I had when I was 14 years old and actually for my life right now playing video games is actually a drain of energy rather than something that gives me energy it gives me joy sure and some it's totally okay to do things that drain your energy they also give you Joy so it's it's it's something I'm a little bit unsure about but you know it's often the things that we think will give us energy don't actually give us energy this is another just as a side note a tip for dealing with burnout that we talk about in the book either way the point of doing the energy audit is that it helps you figure out what it is that you really want and now the final method for how to figure out what you really want by looking backwards to look forwards is to add in some more truth statements so if you saw the early bit in the video I'm now going to play the rest of that conversation with Robin in 12 months time what do you want to be true about you I'd like to be a published author um I'd like to have written a book I'm proud of I'd like to have sh up the foundations of the business I'd like to have lived in Austin for a bit you know a few things like that okay so one one little tweet to that is the language which you used so you said I'm going to I'm going to So when you say I'm going to it kind of gives you permission to kind of put it off into the future okay so when you're creating future trues you have to treat them like they've already happened so you just change the language that I have I am cool y I'm a published author um I have lived in Austin for a few months I've written a book I'm proud of I am currently working on my second book uh I have built my business in a sort of sensible operationally effective way Etc yeah there you go so that's Allie's identity in 12 months time that's that's who you are okay but literally I have a list of like 100 truths all those things both future ones and exist pre-existing ones I know are true about me whenever I have that ele that moment of self-doubt I go back to that and I look at the Legacy which I built up and I look at who I am as my makeup my identity everything and it makes me feel good am I more or less likely to do stuff when I feel good more likely to do you're you're going tock on yeah you're going to see those challenges that you might see as challenges they're going to be just you just going to have taken the edge off it by just giving yourself a little boost of self-confidence and selfworth cuz these things are true can't be taken away from you so that was filmed 7 months ago and actually since then I have now become a published author and our business operations are now more streamlined and I actually spent like two weeks living in Austin rather than a few months cuz various other things came up it was interesting how asking that question what are some truths that you would like to be true about yourself 12 months from now also gives you that that sense a little bit more authentically of what are the things that you really want all of this stuff really feeds into a definition of success that I like which is that success is working towards the things that matter to you and enjoying the journey along the way now if you've been through this video firstly well played you're one of the 10% of people that get to the end of Long YouTube videos like this one you probably want success and happiness and fulfillment but you probably want it on your own terms right you don't just want what someone else's definition of success is or what like like more money or more accolades or more status more achievements all that stuff that Society tells us should be our definition of success it's figuring out what matters to you and working towards it while enjoying the journey and the point of the series is to make that first bit easier to that first bit of figuring out what really matters to you cuz you can do whatever you want you can you can do whatever you set your mind to but you can't do everything that you want and so it's worth really drilling down to what do you actually want what is the goal what is the North Star what are we trying to do here cuz if we know what the goal is if we know what we want then the how takes care of itself like the process of getting there is then easy enough to figure out but what I'm hoping is that this video and some of the prompts in this video and also some of the last video which will be linked up there and down there if you haven't seen it these prompts will give you more of a sense of figuring out what you want now if you haven't seen episode one of this little miniseries that'll be linked right over there and if you have worked through episode one and you'd like to see episode 3 that will be right over there and that is going to be about how to get from where you are to where you want to go through a structured process of dreaming and goal setting our favorite thing so thank you so much for watching have a lovely day and I'll see see you in the next video bye-bye \n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nLearning to identify one's current position is fundamental for

Each resource pool grows or shrinks\nindependently, providing on-demand provisoning at multiple di-\nmensions while improving reliability. We also design our system to\nmitigate the inherent penalty brought by resource disaggregation,\nand introduce optimizations such as optimistic locking and index\nawared prefetching.

The driving force of this\ntrend is threefold. First, cloud vendors provide the \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d\nmodel that allows customers to avoid paying for over-provisioned\nresources, resulting in significant cost reduction. Second, marketing\nactivities such as Black Friday and Singles\u2019 Day often demand\nrapid but transient resource expansion from the database systems\nduring peak time, where cloud vendors can offer such elasticity\nto customers. Third, cloud vendors are able to quickly upgrade\nand evolve the database systems to maintain competitiveness and\nrepair defects in time while sustaining high availability. Customers\nalways expect that node failures, especially planned downtime and\nsoftware upgrades, will have less impact on their business.\nCloud vendors such as AWS [ 43], Azure [ 2], GCP and Alibaba [ 9]\nprovide relational database as a services (DBaaS). There are three\ntypical architectures for cloud databases: monolithic machine (Fig-\nure 1), virtual machine with remote disk (Figure 2(a)), and shared\nstorage (Figure 2(b)), and the last two can be referred as separation of\ncompute and storage. Though these architectures have been widely\nused, they all suffer from challenges caused by resource coupling.\nUnder the monolithic machine architecture, all resources (such\nas CPU, memory and storage) are tightly coupled. The DBaaS plat-\nform needs to solve bin-packing problems when assigning database\ninstances to machines. It is difficult to make different resources\nallocated on a physical machine all have a high utilization rate,\nwhich is prone to fragmentation. Moreover, it is difficult to meet\nthe demands of customers to adjust individual resources flexibly\naccording to the load at runtime. Finally, a system with tightly\ncoupled resources has the problem of fate sharing, i.e., the failure\nof one resource will cause the failure of other resources. Resources\ncannot be recovered independently and transparently, which leads\nto longer system recovery time.\nWith the separation of compute and storage architecture, DBaaS\ncan independently improve the resource utilization of the storage\npool. The shared storage subtype further reduces storage costs \u2014\nthe primary and read replicas can attach and share the same storage.\nRead replicas help to serve high volume read traffic and offload ana-\nlytical queries from the primary. However, in all these architectures,\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n2477\nReplicationMonolithic ServerCPUMemoryStorageMonolithic ServerCPUMemoryStorageFigure 1: monolithic machine\nReplicationCompute NodeCPUMemoryCompute NodeCPUMemoryStorageStorage NodeStorageStorage NodeNetworkStorage PoolStorage Pool(a)virtual machine with remote disk\nCoordinationCompute NodeCPUMemoryCompute NodeCPUMemoryStorageStorage NodeStorage PoolNetwork(b)shared storage\nFigure 2: separation of compute and storage\nCoordinationCompute NodeLocalMemoryCPUStorageStorage NodeStorage PoolMemoryMemory NodeMemory PoolCompute NodeLocalMemoryCPUNetwork Figure 3: disaggregation\nproblems like bin-packing of CPU and memory, lacking of flexible\nand scalable memory resources, remain unsolved. Furthermore,\neach read replica keeps a redundant in-memory data copy, leading\nto high memory costs.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel cloud database design par-\nadigm of the disaggregation architecture (Figure 3). It goes one\nstep further than the shared storage architecture, to address the\naforementioned problems. The disaggregation architecture runs\nin the disaggregated data centers (DDC), in which CPU, memory\nand storage resources are no longer tightly coupled as in a mono-\nlithic machine. Resources are located in different nodes connected\nthrough high-speed network. As a result, each resource type im-\nproves its utilization rate and expands its volume independently.\nThis also eliminates fate sharing, allowing each resource be be re-\ncovered from failure and upgraded independently. Moreover, data\npages in the remote memory pool can be shared among multiple\ndatabase processes, analogous to the storage pool being shared\ninshared storage architecture. Adding a read replica no longer in-\ncreases the cost of memory resources, except for consuming a small\npiece of local memory.\nA trend in recent years is that cloud-native database vendors are\nlaunching serverless variants [ 3,4]. The main feature of serverless\ndatabases is on-demand resource provisioning (such as auto-scaling\nand auto-pause), which should be transparent and seamless without\ninterrupting customer workloads. Most cloud-native databases are\nimplemented based on the shared storage architecture, where CPU\nand memory resources are coupled and must be scaled at the same\ntime. In addition, auto-pause has to release both resources, resulting\nin long resumption time. We show that disaggregation architecture\ncan overcome these limitations.\nPolarDB Serverless is a cloud-native database implementation\nthat follows the disaggregation architecture. Similar to major cloud-\nnative database products like Aurora, HyperScale, and PolarDB1,\nit includes one primary (RW node) and multiple read replicas (RO\nnodes) in the database node layer. With the disaggregation architec-\nture, it is possible to support multiple primaries (RW nodes), but\nthis is not within the scope of this paper.\nThe design of a multi-tenant scale-out memory pool is intro-\nduced in PolarDB Serverless , including page allocation and life cycle\nmanagement. The first challenge is to ensure that the system exe-\ncutes transactions correctly after adding remote memory to the\nsystem. For example, read after write should not miss any updates\neven across nodes. We realize it using cache invalidation. When\n1PolarDB Serverless is developed on a fork of PolarDB\u2019s codebase.RW is splitting or merging a B+Tree index, other RO nodes should\nnot see an inconsistent B-tree structure in the middle. We protect\nit with global page latches. When a RO node performs read-only\ntransactions, it must avoid reading anything written by uncommit-\nted transactions. We achieve it through the synchronization of read\nviews between database nodes.\nThe evolution of the disaggregation architecture could have a\nnegative impact on the database performance. It is because the\ndata is likely to be accessed from the remote, which introduces\nsignificant network latency. The second challenge is to execute\ntransactions efficiently . We exploit RDMA optimization exten-\nsively, especially one-sided RDMA verbs, including using RDMA\nCAS [ 42] to optimize the acquisition of global latches. In order\nto improve concurrency, both RW and RO use optimistic locking\ntechniques to avoid unnecessary global latches. On the storage side,\npage materialization offloading allows dirty pages to be evicted\nfrom remote memory without flushing them to the storage, while\nindex-aware prefetching improve query performance.\nThe disaggregation architecture complicates the system and\nhence increases the variety and probability of system failures. As a\ncloud database service, the third challenge is to build a reliable sys-\ntem, we summarize our strategies to handle single-node crashes of\ndifferent node types which guarantee that there is no single-point\nfailure in the system. Because the states in memory and storage are\ndecoupled from the database node, crash recovery time of the RW\nnode becomes 5.3 times faster than that in the monolithic machine\narchitecture.\nWe summarize our main contributions as follows:\n\u2022We propose the disaggregation architecture and present the\ndesign of PolarDB Serverless , which is the first cloud database\nimplementation following the architecture. We demonstrate\nthat this architecture provides new opportunities for the\ndesign of new cloud-native and serverless databases.\n\u2022We provide design details and optimizations that make the\nsystem work correctly and efficiently, overcoming the perfor-\nmance drawbacks brought by the disaggregation architecture.\n\u2022We describe our fault tolerance strategies, including the\nhandling of single-point failures and cluster failures.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,\nwe introduce backgrounds of PolarDB and DDC. Section 3 explains\nthe design of PolarDB Serverless . Section 4 presents our performance\noptimizations. Section 5 discusses our fault tolerance and recov-\nery strategies. Section 6 gives the experimental results. Section 7\nreviews the related work, and Section 8 concludes the paper.\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n2478RW node\nPolarFSRO nodes\nstorage nodeBuffer poolBuffer poollibpfs\nParallelRaftlibpfsi1\n23\n45678RedologRedolog\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41!\"!min\t{\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41!\"!}8\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41!#99\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc41!\"!proxy nodeLoad Balancer9Figure 4: PolarDB Architecture\n2 BACKGROUND\n2.1 PolarDB\nPolarDB [ 26] is a cloud-native database with shared storage architec-\nture. It is derived from the MySQL code base and uses PolarFS [ 9] as\nthe underlying storage pool. It includes one primary (RW node) and\nmultiple read replicas (RO nodes) in the compute node layer. Like a\ntraditional database kernel, Each RW or RO node contains a SQL\nprocessor, transaction engines (like InnoDB [ 35], X-Engine [ 18]),\nand a buffer pool to serve queries and transactions. In addition,\nthere are some stateless proxy nodes for load balancing.\nPolarFS is a durable, atomic and scale-out distributed storage\nservice. It provides virtual volumes that are partitioned into chunks\nof 10GB size which are distributed in multiple storage nodes. A\nvolume contains up to 10000 chunks, and can provide a maximum\ncapacity of 100TB. Chunks are provisioned on demand so that\nvolume space grows dynamically. Each chunk has three replicas,\nand linear serializable is guaranteed through Parallel Raft, which is\na consensus protocol derived from Raft.\nThe RW node and RO nodes synchronize memory status through\nredo logs, and coordinate consistency through log sequence num-\nber(LSN), which indicates an offset of redo log files in InnoDB. As\nshown in Figure 4, in a transaction 1\u25cb, after RW finishes flushing\nall redo log records to PolarFS 2\u25cb, the transaction can be committed\n3\u25cb. RW broadcasts messages that the redo log have been updated\nand the latest LSN lsnRWto all RO nodes asynchronously 4\u25cb. After\nthe node ROireceived the message from RW, it pulls updates of\nredo log from PolarFS 5\u25cb, and applies them to the buffered page\nin buffer pool 6\u25cb, so that ROikeeps synchronization with RW.\nThen ROipiggybacks the consumed redo log offset lsnRO iin the\nreply and send it back to RW 7\u25cb. RW can purge the redo log be-\nfore the min{lsnRO i}location, and flush the dirty pages elder than\nmin{lsnRO i}to PolarFS in the background 8\u25cb. While ROican serve\nread transactions using the snapshot isolation with version before\nlsnRO i9\u25cb. Some RO nodes may fall behind because of high CPU\nutilization or network congestion. Say there is a certain node ROk,\nwhose LSN lsnRO kis much lower than that of RW lsnRW(the lag\nis larger than one million). Such node ROkwill be detected and\nkicked out of the cluster to avoid slowing down RW to flush dirty\npages.\nLeafLeafToRToR\u2026\u2026PoDLeafLeafToRToR\u2026\u2026LeafLeafToRToR\u2026\u2026PoDLeafLeafToRToR\u2026\u2026SpineSpineSpineSpineSpine\u2026\u2026\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Figure 5: Network Architecture at Alibaba\nProxy nodes provide transparent load balancing service for sep-\narating read and write traffics, distribute read requests to RO nodes\nand forward write requests to RW.\n2.2 Disaggregated Data Centers\nIn disaggregated data centers, compute nodes, memory nodes, and\nstorage nodes are interconnected through a high-speed network.\nThe recent development of RDMA network technology [ 17] (such\nas InfiniBand, RoCE/RoCEv2, and iWARP) makes it possible to build\nlarge-scale disaggregated data centers. Alibaba\u2019s data center net-\nwork is an Ethernet-based multi-layer clos network, which adopts\nRDMA technology RoCEv2 based on Ethernet.\nAs shown in Figure 5, a typical data center at Alibaba has three\nlayers: the spine layer, the leaf layer, and the ToR layer. A ToR switch\nconnects up to 48 nodes. ToR switches connect to leaf switches.\nLeaf switches connect to spine switches. Each machine is equipped\nwith a dual-port RDMA NIC, which is connected to two different\nToR switches to support continuous service in case of single net-\nwork link failure. A leaf switch group is composed of multiple leaf\nswitches, which provide services at the same time and serve as back-\nups for each other. The collection of racks and servers managed\nby a leaf switches group is called a PoD (Point of Delivery). A PoD\ncontains up to 32 groups of ToR, thus more than 1500 servers. The\nservers in a PoD are interconnected through the RDMA network.\nUnder the disaggregation architecture, the computation, memory\nand storage resources required by a single database instance are\nallocated under the same PoD. And, the resources of different in-\nstances can be placed to different PoDs. Computation and memory\nresources tend to be allocated together under the same ToR for\nlower latency and fewer jitters.\n2.3 Serverless Databases\nServerless databases are highly elastic derivatives of cloud-native\ndatabases, such as AWS Aurora Serverless [ 3] and Azure SQL Server-\nless [ 4]. Their main design goal is on-demand resource provision-\ning, which enables agile resource adjustment according to actual\nworkloads and provides a pay-as-you-go payment model. More\nspecifically, auto-scaling pops up resources during peak periods\nand shrinks when the surge subsides. This can help many businesses\nmeet both their performance and budget constraints. Similarly, auto-\npause releases computing resources during inactive periods and\nhence only storage consumption is billed. When traffic comes, the\ndatabase can be automatically resumed with little recovery time.\nThe auto-scaling capacity of existing serverless databases have\nlimitations, due to the underlying shared storage architecture [ 2,43].\nTheir CPU and memory resources are tightly coupled, which must\nbe scaled up and down simultaneously at the granularity of resource\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n2479unit. A resource unit is a package of fixed CPU and memory re-\nsources on the compute nodes (virtual machines or containers),\ne.g., an ACU (Aurora Compute Unit) contains 2 GiB of memory\nand associated virtual processor. This setting fixes the resource\nratio and is inadequate to satisfy all scenarios. For example, ana-\nlytical database customers have higher requirement for memory\ncapacity than for CPU capacity, since large amounts of data should\nbe cached in memory for fast access. In contrast, transactional\ndatabase customers demands more CPU resources to support their\nbusiness peaks, where small memory is adequate for a high cache\nhit rate. Under the disaggregation architecture, since CPU and mem-\nory are completely decoupled, the resource provision can be more\ncost-effective for auto-scaling.\nSimilarly, the auto-pause capacity of existing serverless databases\nare also limited. They have to release both CPU and memory re-\nsources, resulting in relatively long resumption time. Under the\ndisaggregation architecture, CPU and memory no longer share fate.\nHence, memory can be retained during auto-pause and database\nresumption becomes much faster, which eliminates the loading of\nkey data (such as data dictionary and pages) from remote storage.\nMoreover, scaling transparency is another design goal for server-\nless databases. Ideally, even when the database scales across com-\npute nodes, the migration shall not interrupt customer workloads.\nWith the disaggregation architecture, ephemeral states of the data-\nbase (such as dirty pages, transaction status, logical locks, and\nintermediate query results) can be stored in the shared memory,\nwhich provides more opportunities for better transparency. PolarDB\nServerless now stores dirty pages in shared memory and others are\nleft for future work.\n3 DESIGN\nPolarDB Serverless is a cloud native database of the disaggregation\narchitecture, evolved from PolarDB. Similar to the PolarDB archi-\ntecture described in Section 2.1, each PolarDB Serverless instance\nconsists of multiple proxy nodes, one RW node, multiple RO nodes,\nand uses PolarFS as the underlying storage pool. The biggest differ-\nence with PolarDB is the use of the remote memory pool.\nThe advantage of shared memory is that it allows pages to be\nshared between RW and RO nodes instead of maintaining a private\ncopy for each node, which improves memory resource usage. The\nsize of shared memory can be scaled horizontally, allowing the data-\nbase to have a larger memory pool where data can be completely\ncached. This memory pool has lower latency than remote storage\nand is conductive to analytic workloads. However, the adoption\nof shared memory also brings a performance penalty. In particu-\nlar, the following issues are addressed: First, the access speed of\nremote memory is much slower than that of local memory, where\na tiering memory system and optimizations like prefetching are\nrequired. Second, the private pages previously managed by RW and\nRO now become shared resources, where a mechanism for cross-\nnode mutual exclusion is required. We extensively use low-latency\none-sided RDMA verbs (like RDMA CAS [ 42]) and optimistic pro-\ntocols to avoid the use of global latches. Third, the transmission\nof pages (e.g. flushing dirty pages) brings burden to the network.\nSimilar to Aurora and Socrates, we write redo logs to the storage\nand materialize pages from logs asynchronously.3.1 Disaggregated Memory\n3.1.1 Remote Memory Access Interface. Database processes access\nthe remote memory pool via the librmem interface. The five most\nimportant APIs are listed below. A Page is identified by the page_id\n(space, page_no ).page_register andpage_unregister manage the life\ncycle of cached pages inside the remote memory. The database node\nobtains the address of a page in the remote memory pool through\npage_register, and increases the page\u2019s reference count by one. If\nthe page does not exist, this function allocates space for the page\nin the remote memory pool, otherwise, the page is copied to the\ncaller\u2019s local cache. Conversely, page_unregister decreases the page\nreference count by one. When the page reference count reaches 0,\nthe page can be deleted from the remote memory pool. page_read\nfetches a page from the remote memory pool to the local cache\nusing one-sided RDMA read. page_write writes a page from the\nlocal cache to the remote memory pool using one-sided RDMA\nwrite. page_invalidate is called by RW to invalidate all copies of a\ngiven page in RO nodes\u2019 local cache.\nint page_register(PageID page_id,\nconst Address local_addr,\nAddress& remote_addr,\nAddress& pl_addr,\nbool& exists);\nint page_unregister(PageID page_id);\nint page_read(const Address local_addr,\nconst Address remote_addr);\nint page_write(const Address local_addr,\nconst Address remote_addr);\nint page_invalidate(PageID page_id);\n3.1.2 Remote Memory Management. The memory resources re-\nquired by an instance can be provisioned from multiple memory\nnodes. The unit of memory allocation is a slab, and the size of each\nslab is 1 GB.\nPage Array (PA) Each slab is implemented by a PA data struc-\nture. A PA is a contiguous piece of memory containing an array\nof 16 KB pages. When a memory node boots, all memory regions\nwhere PAs are located will be registered to the RDMA NIC, so that\nthe page stored in PAs can be accessed directly by remote nodes\nthrough one-sided RDMA verbs.\nThe memory node that serves slabs is also called a slab node. A\nslab node can hold multiple slabs, and the memory resources of\neach instance are distributed over one or more slab nodes. When\neach instance is created, the DBaaS will reserve all the slabs that the\ninstance required according to its predefined buffer pool capacity.\nThe slab node where the first slab is located is assigned as the home\nnode. Compared with ordinary slab nodes, the home node contains\nsome additional instance-wise metadata:\nPage Address Table (PAT) PAT is a hash table that records the\nlocation (slab node id and physical memory address) and reference\ncount of each page. In page_register, the home node determines\nwhether a page already exists by looking up the PAT table. If it does\nnot exist, an entry will be added to the PAT table after the page is\nallocated in the remote memory pool. In page_unregister, when a\npage\u2019s reference count drops to 0 and is evicted from the remote\nmemory pool, the corresponding entry in the PAT will be deleted.\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n2480Page Invalidation Bitmap (PIB) PIB is a bitmap. For each\nentry in the PAT table, there is an invalidation bit in PIB. Value 0\nindicates that the copy of the page in the memory pool is of the latest\nversion, while value 1 means that the RW node has updated the page\nin its local cache and haven\u2019t written it back to the remote memory\npool yet. There is also a local PIB on each RO node, indicating\nwhether each page in the RO node\u2019s local cache is outdated.\nPage Reference Directory (PRD) PRD is another mapping\ntable. For each entry in the PAT table, there is a list of database\nnodes tracked in the PRD, which means that these nodes have\nobtained a reference of this page through calling page_register. PIB\nand PRD are used together to achieve cache coherency, see Section\n3.1.4.\nPage Latch Table (PLT) PLT manages a page latch (PL) for\neach entry in the PAT table. PL is a global physical lock protect-\ning and synchronizing read and write on pages between different\ndatabase nodes. Especially it is used to protect the B+ Tree\u2019s struc-\ntural integrity when multiple database nodes access the same index\nconcurrently, see Section 3.2.\nHere is the process of how an instance allocates a page from\nthe remote memory: The database process sends a page_register\nrequest to the home node. If the page doesn\u2019t exist, the home node\nscans all existing slabs to find the one which has the most free\nmemory available. If there is no free memory in any slab, it looks\nfor pages with a reference count of 0, which can be evicted by the\nLRU algorithm. Because the storage supports page materialization\noffloading, even dirty pages can also be evicted instantaneously\nwithout flushing back. The home node then writes page location\ninto the PAT and returns the remote addresses of the page and\ncorresponding PL to the caller. During the process of page allocation,\nthere is no interaction between the home node and slab nodes for\nefficiency. As traditional databases, there is a background thread\nthat periodically evicts pages and keeps slab nodes having free\npages to avoid evicting pages in the foreground.\nWhen the user expands the buffer pool size elastically, the home\nnode will request the DBaaS to allocate new slabs, and expand the\nbuffer pool size of the instance and the metadata like PAT, PIB and\nPD accordingly. On the contrary, if the buffer pool size is shrunk on-\ndemand, the extra memory can be released through the LRU page\neviction algorithm. Then pages are migrated in the background to\ndefragment, and unused slabs are released finally.\n3.1.3 Local Cache. Due to the expensive delay brought by net-\nwork communication, the database process can\u2019t directly read or\nin-place modify the page data in remote memory like accessing\nlocal memory, otherwise the CPU will spend a lot of cycles stalling\nand waiting for the data to be read from the network to fill in\nthe CPU cache line. It\u2019s necessary to read data from the remote\nmemory to the local cache in units of pages, and then directly ma-\nnipulate the pages in the local cache like traditional monolithic\ndatabase. The size of local cache is tunable and empirically set to\nmin{1\n8\u2217Size remote _memor y,128GB}, because this ratio provides\na balance between performance and cost (e.g., less than 30% perfor-\nmance drop in benchmarks like sysbench, TPC-C, TPC-H). In the\nfuture, we plan to dynamically adjust local cache size according to\ncustom workloads and hit ratio [41].\nRWnodeHome NodeROnode 1\nPagePagePagePagePagePage1Pagepage_invalidatePage\u2026\u20261\u2026\u2026PIB\nPagePagePagePage\nSlab Nodes\u2026\u20261\u2026\u2026PIB\u2026\u2026RO 1,RO 2\u2026\u2026PRDPage\u2026\u20261\u2026\u2026PIBPagePageROnode 2\nPage\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026PIBPagePageROnode 3\n2345566778Figure 6: Cache Invalidation\nIf an accessed page does not reside in the remote memory, the\ndatabase process reads the page from PolarFS to the local cache\nthrough libpfs, and then writes it to the remote memory using\nlibrmem. There is no direct communication between memory nodes\nand storage nodes. Not all pages read from PolarFS need to be\nwritten into the remote memory, for example, when the database\nprocess is performing a full table scan. Because the page load by\nthe full table scan is unlikely to be read again in the near future, it\nwould squeeze out other pages cached in the remote memory and\npollute the cache.\nWhen a local cache miss occurs, the database process needs to\nwait for pages to be fetched from remote memory or remote stor-\nage, which is much slower than local memory/storage. Therefore,\nenhancing the hit ratio of local cache through prefetching is the\nkey to improve performance. Detailed description is in Section 4.2.\nWhen the local cache is full, pages need to be evicted. Page\neviction uses the LRU algorithm. Clean pages can be freed directly,\nand modified pages need to be written back to remote memory\nbefore they can be released. Besides, the database process should\ncallpage_unregister to decrease the reference count of the page.\n3.1.4 Cache Coherency. In PolarDB, the buffer pool of database\nprocesses are private to themselves. A RO node cannot directly\naccess pages with the latest version in RW\u2019s buffer pool. Therefore,\nthe RO node captures updated versions of pages by replaying redo\nlogs to its buffer pool continuously, see Section 2.1. In PolarDB\nServerless , RW can write back modified pages to the remote memory,\nwhich can be seen instantaneously by other RO nodes. Thus RO\nnodes no longer need to replay redo logs. However, in order to\nreduce the overhead of network communication on modifying a\npage, RW\u2019s changes to a page will be buffered in the local cache\nand will not be synchronized to the remote memory immediately.\nWhat\u2019s more, RO nodes may also have copies of pages held in\nthe local cache. This requires a synchronization mechanism. After\nRW modifies a page in its local cache, the remote memory and\nother RO nodes that cache this page should know that their copies\nare outdated. This mechanism is called cache invalidation, which\nensures cache coherency.\nFigure 6 illustrates how cache invalidation works, which is im-\nplemented based on the PIB and PRD data structures described in\nSection 3.1.2. After RW updates a page in its local cache, it calls\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n2481page_invalidate 1\u25cb. This function will set the corresponding bit in\nPIB on the home node 3\u25cb, look up PRD to get a list of RO nodes (RO\nnode 1 and 2 in this example) which hold copies in their local cache\n4\u25cb, and then set the corresponding bit in PIB on those RO nodes 6\u25cb.\npage_invalidate is a synchronous blocking operation. Only when\nPIBs on all participants are set, can it return successfully 7\u25cb8\u25cb. If\nthere is an abnormal RO node which doesn\u2019t respond after timeout,\nDBaaS will be involved to kick off the node out of the cluster to\nensure page_invalidate succeed.\nA transaction is divided into multiple mini-transactions (MTR),\nwhich is a group of continuous redo log records. Before redo logs in\na MTR are flushed to PolarFS, all modified pages in the MTR must\nbe invalidated using the page_invalidate interface. This can ensure\nthat there is no such page in the remote memory, and its state is\nvalid, but the version is older than the state of data on the PolarFS\n(pages plus redo logs). Crash recovery of the database node relies\non this property, which is described in Section 5.1.\n3.2 B+Tree\u2019s Structural Consistency\nConcurrency control of B+Trees on a multi-processor system is\nwidely studied, which includes two aspects of work: The first prob-\nlem is how to guarantee the physical consistency when multiple\nthreads work on the same index simultaneously [ 10,15,25,30]. If\nnot properly protected, some threads could access a page while\nanother thread is modifying it, resulting in them following stale\nor dangling links. The second problem is how to maintain the\nlogical consistency and satisfy various snapshot isolation levels\nwhen there are concurrent transactions working on the same set of\ndata [29, 32\u201334].\nThis section mainly discusses how to solve the first problem in\nPolarDB Serverless , particularly how to update B+tree in RW, while\nallowing other RO nodes to maintain a consistent view of physical\nB+tree structure to traverse simultaneously. The second topic will\nbe discussed in the next section.\nInPolarDB Serverless , only RW can modify pages, so there is\nno need to protect write conflicts caused by modifications from\nmultiple nodes at the same time. However, Structure Modification\nOperations (SMO) will modify multiple pages at a time, which may\ncause RO nodes to see an inconsistent physical B+tree structure\nwhen traversing the tree. For example, RW splits a leaf node A\ninto two nodes, A\u2032(previously A) and A\u2032\u2032(new allocated), and then\ninsert it into the parent node, changing BtoB\u2032. But when a RO\nnode traverses root-to-leaf concurrently, it may see the parent node\nB(before the split) and the node A\u2032(after the split), therefore the\nnode A\u2032\u2032and data inside it will be missed.\nWe solved this problem using PL. PL is the global physical latch\nwith two locking modes: S and X. It does not replace the local page\nlatch which is used to synchronize modification on a single node,\ninstead it is an add on to make sure the integrity of index structure\nin a multi-node environment, and it works with algorithms like\ncrabbing/lock coupling. All pages involved in SMOs will be X-locked\nwith PL until the SMO is completed. Conversely, all reads on RO\nneed to check with PLT if the page being read is X-locked, and place\nan S-lock on the page being read. For the example in the previous\nparagraph, during a root-to-leaf traversal, RO will first add a S-lock\nto the parent node B, then add a S-lock to the leaf node A, at lastrelease the S-lock of the Bnode. For RW insert/delete operations,\nPolarDB Serverless always adopt two step approaches. First it will\ndo an optimistic tree traversal for insert/delete, assuming no SMO\nrequired. In such case, only local latches are required. And if indeed\nno SMO is required, the data will be directly inserted or deleted\non the leaf page. If the optimistic traversal finds the leaf page is\nrelatively full or empty and a SMO is possible, then it will restart\na \"pessimistic\" traversal from the root again, now it starts placing\nX latches as well as X-PL locks on all nodes that could be possibly\ninvolved in the SMO. In above example, RW needs to add a X-lock\ntoBfirst, then add a X-lock to A, these locks won\u2019t be released until\nthe split is complete. The lock ordering can ensure that RO either\nsee the B+tree structure before SMO ( AandB) or the structure after\nSMO ( B\u2032,A\u2032,A\u2032\u2032), because the X-locks on A and B can be regarded\nas a barrier.\nTo reduce the PL lock cost, PL has a \u201cstickness\u201d property, which\nmeans that it does not require to be released right after SMO as\nlong as there is no request from other RO nodes. The benefit of this\nproperty is that the node does not need to request the lock again\nfrom the central PLT lock manager for next request if it still holds\nthis lock.\nTo speed up the PL-acquisition operation, we first try to use\nRDMA CAS [ 42] operation to acquire the lock (the address of a\npage\u2019s PL is returned together in page_register). If the fast path\nfails, for example, trying X-lock a PL that has been S-locked, which\nmay occur when splitting the root node, then get the lock through\nnegotiation among the home node and database nodes. The caller\nrequesting the lock needs to wait for the negotiation to complete.\n3.3 Snapshot Isolation\nPolarDB Serverless provides SI (snapshot isolation) [ 14] based on\nMVCC. Same as InnoDB\u2019s Implementation of MVCC, previous\nversions of a record are constructed with undo logs. In PolarDB\nServerless , a transaction relies on a snapshot timestamp to control\nwhat version of records the transaction is allowed to see. It main-\ntains a centralized timestamp (sequence) named CTS in RW, to\nallocate a monotonic increasing timestamp for all database nodes.\nA read-write transaction needs to acquire the timestamp from\nCTS twice, once at the beginning of the transaction ( cts_read ),\nand the other time at the commit time ( cts_commit ). When the\ntransaction commits, it writes down cts_commit together with the\nrecords it modified. All records and undo records reserve a column\nto store cts_commit of the transaction which modified it. Reads\nwithin a transaction always return the value of the most recent ver-\nsion of records whose cts_commit is smaller than the transaction\u2019s\ncts_read . Each version of record has a field to store the trx_idof\nthe transaction that modifies it, with which each transaction could\nrecognize its own writes. A read-only transaction only needs to get\nacts_read timestamp once at the beginning of the transaction.\nHowever, for large transactions, cts commit cannot be updated\nimmediately for all modified rows, which incurs a large number of\nrandom writes when the transaction commits. Thus, cts_commit\ncolumns need to be filled asynchronously in the background. This\napproach leads to the problem that concurrent transactions can-\nnot determine the version of rows that are not yet filled with\ncts_commit . This problem is solved by looking up the CTS Log data\nstructure on RW. The CTS Log is a circular array, which records\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n2482the cts_commit timestamp of the most recent read-write transac-\ntions (for example, the last 1,000,000). If the transaction has not\nyet been committed, the value of its commit timestamp is null.\nWhen any database node reads a record or undo record with miss-\ning cts_commit, it can look up the CTS Log to determine whether\nthe transaction has been committed, or whether the committed\ntransaction is visible to current transaction.\nObtaining the timestamp and determining whether the record is\nvisible are high frequency operations in transaction processing. We\nuse one-sided RDMA verbs extensively to optimize the timestamp\nacquisition and the CTS array access. The CTS timestamp counter\nis fetched and incremented atomically using RDMA CAS [ 42]. In\naddition, the CTS Log is placed in a contiguous memory region\nregistered to RDMA NIC, so that RO nodes can efficiently lookup\nit through one-sided RDMA read. Compared with using RPC, it\nachieves superior performance without taking up RW\u2019s CPU re-\nsources, which prevents the RW node from becoming a bottleneck.\n3.4 Page Materialization Offloading\nTraditional monolithic databases periodically flush dirty pages to\ndurable storage. However, it introduces a large amount of net-\nwork communications between RW, memory nodes and PolarFS\ninPolarDB Serverless , and affects the performance of high-priority\noperations in the critical path, such as log writes and page reads.\nIn order to mitigate network bottleneck, Aurora [ 43] proposed the\nconcept of \u201clog is database\u201d. It treats redo log records as a series\nof incremental page modifications, generates the latest version of\npages by applying redo logs continuously to the pages on the stor-\nage nodes. Socrates [ 2] further evolved on this basis, separating log\nfrom storage. Logs are first persisted to the XLOG service, and then\nasynchronously sent to a group of page servers. Each page server\nis responsible for a database partition, independently replays the\nlogs, generates pages and serves GetPage@LSN requests.\nPolarDB adopts a similar approach, which is closer to Socrates.\nWe extend PolarFS such that logs and pages are separately stored\nin two types of chunks (i.e., log chunk and page chunk). Redo logs\nare first persisted to log chunks and then asynchronously sent to\npage chunks, where logs are applied to update pages. The difference\nagainst Socrates is that, in order to reuse PolarFS components and\nminimize changes, logs are sent only to the leader node of the page\nchunk, who will materialize pages and propagate updates to other\nreplicas through ParallelRaft. This method adds additional latency\nto the ApplyLog operation due to the replication cost. However, it is\nnot a critical issue because ApplyLog is an asynchronous operation\nnot in the critical path. Moreover, since the replicated state machine\nguarantees data consistency between page chunks, there is no need\nfor an extra gossip protocol among storage nodes like in Aurora.\nAs illustrated in Figure 7, a storage node in PolarFS can host\nmultiple log chunks and page chunks at the same time. Before a\ntransaction commits, RW flushes changes of redo log files into log\nchunks. After data written is replicated to three replicas, the trans-\naction can be committed 1\u25cb. After that, RW decomposes changes\nof redo logs into log records. According to the pages involved in\neach log record, a log record is only sent to the corresponding page\nchunks, whose partition will be affected by the log record 2\u25cb. Each\nOLESIV5HGRORJ\n9ZUXGMKTUJKY/RJ\u0003FKXQN3DJHFKXQNSDUWLWLRQ\u0003\u0003\u001318=TUJK\n3DJHFKXQNSDUWLWLRQ\u0003\u0003\u0014/RJ\u0003UHFRUGV/RJ\u0003UHFRUGV\u044e\u044e2\n\u0254\u025434XHXH&DFKH5HGRORJ+DVK4567893OLESIV85TUJK\n-KZ6GMK\n3DJH\u0003,QGH[5HGRORJ+DVKFigure 7: Page Materialization Offloading\npage chunk maintains a partition (about 10 GB) of the database,\nand only receives relevant log records.\nAfter the page chunk\u2019s leader node receives log records from\nRW 3\u25cb, it immediately persists these records to replicas to ensure\ndurability 4\u25cb, and inserts them to a in-memory hash which uses\nthe page id as the key 5\u25cb, and then acknowledges RW 6\u25cb. At this\npoint, dirty pages in RW can be evicted. Unless step 6\u25cbcompletes,\nRW always holds references of the dirty pages in its local cache, so\nthat the dirty pages won\u2019t be evicted on the remote memory either.\nIn the background, the old versions of pages are read from the\ncache or the disk, which are merged with the log records inside\nthe memory hash 7\u25cb. After that, the new version of the pages are\nwritten to a new location to replicas 8\u25cb. The underlying storage will\nhold multiple versions of the page for a period of time, and support\nfast point-in-time recovery. GC is performed to collect redo logs\nand old versions in the background 9\u25cb. When serving a GetPage\nrequest, the leader node merges the version in the cache/disk, and\nlog records on the page in the memory hash, generates the latest\npage and returns it to the database node.\n3.5 Auto-Scaling\nThe capability of transparent and seamless scaling without in-\nterrupting customer workloads is essential for serverless databases.\nIdeally, even when the database reboots or migrates across compute\nnodes, applications should not be aware of any exceptions, such\nas database disconnections, aborted transactions and unacceptably\nlong response time. In PolarDB Serverless , when a switching event\noccurs (e.g., version upgrade or cross-node migration), the proxy\nnode is responsible for keeping client connections alive. It pauses\nactive transactions and stops forwarding subsequent statements\nto the old RW node. It then waits for a short period (e.g. 100 ms),\nwhich is long enough for the old RW node to complete most of\nin-progress statements. After that, the old node flushes all dirty\npages to the shared memory and shuts down itself. Meanwhile,\nthe new RW node will attach to the shared memory and initialize\nits local memory state (e.g., scanning the undo header to rebuild\nthe active transaction list). At last, the proxy connects to the new\nRW node, restores its session states, and then forwards pending\nstatements for execution. Note that long-running statements that\nhave not been completed by the old RW node will be reissued after\nthe new RW node rolls them back.\nFor long-running multi-statement transactions, such as bulk\ninsertions, the proxy also tracks a savepoint for each statement.\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n2483The savepoint indicates the execution progress of the transaction,\ni.e., the i-th statement since the beginning of the transaction. As a\nresult, when the switching event happens, the proxy can inform\nthe new RW node to resume execution from the latest savepoint,\nwhich avoids rolling back the entire transaction and significantly\nimproves migration transparency.\nRecall that during the switching process, active transactions\nneed to be paused until the new RW node takes over the service. It\nis hence critical to shorten the pause. In PolarDB Serverless , trans-\nferring transaction states (e.g. dirty pages and rollback segments)\nthrough shared memory is faster than the traditional way that re-\nlies on remote storage. Other optimizations such as statement-level\nrollback are also helpful. Overall, we can reduce the pause time to\n2-3 seconds (as shown in Section 6.3). We plan to investigate more\noptimizations as future work, such as putting transaction locks\nin shared memory to support multiple RW nodes, and caching in-\ntermediate results in shared memory to speedup analytical query\nresumption.\n4 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS\nThe evolution of the disaggregated architecture could have a nega-\ntive impact on the database performance, since data is likely to be\naccessed from the remote-memory nodes and storage nodes, involv-\ning notable network latency. To address this problem, we employ a\nsuite of optimizations to minimize the chances of compromise.\n4.1 Optimistic Locking\nIn Section 3.2, we describe that the RO node uses the lock coupling\nprotocol to acquire PL locks on the pages during the traversal from\nroot to leaf. Even if RW performs SMO at the same time, RO can still\nsee a consistent B+ tree physical structure. Although in most cases,\nthe acquisition of PL can be successfully completed through the\nfast path of RDMA CAS [ 42], it may still degenerate into multiple\nrounds of negotiations. In this section, we propose an Optimistic\nLocking mechanism. It is optimistic to assume that the RO node\nwill not encounter SMO during a root-to-leaf traversal, so there is\nno need to obtain any PL. When SMO is detected, try again or fall\nback to the pessimistic strategy. SMO can be detected like this. A\nSMO counter is maintained on RW, namely SMO RW. Whenever\nSMO occurs in the B-tree, the counter is incremented by one. When\nSMO occurs, the snapshot of SMO RW(SMO pa\u0434e) is recorded on\nall pages modified by SMO. At the beginning of each query, the\nsnapshot of the SMO counter is obtained as SMO quer y. When the\nRO node executes this query and traverses from root to leaf, it stops\nif it finds that SMO pa\u0434eof any page on the path is greater than\nSMO quer y. It means that SMO occurs during the query, so that it\nmay read an inconsistent B+tree.\n4.2 Index-Awared Prefetching\nSome systems implement data prefetching strategies [ 31,44] at\nthe operating system and storage levels, which are agnostic to the\ndatabase workloads. However by checking the SQL plan generated\nin the database kernel, we can use such information to accurately\npredict which blocks will be accessed next and prefetch them in\nadvance. In PolarDB Serverless , we propose Batched Key PrePare\n(BKP). BKP prefetches pages containing interesting tuples from\ndisaggregated memory and storage to hide remote I/O latency.Similar prefetching methods has also been used in hash join to\navoid CPU cache misses [11].\nThere are a large number of daily database operations that access\nsecondary indexes. For example:\nselect name, address, mail\nfrom employee where age > 17\nIn this example, the field agehas a secondary index, but the other\nfields name, address, and mail must be read from the primary index.\nWhen MySQL executes this statement, The typical process is to first\nscan a batch of qualified record primary keys from the secondary\nindex and then read other fields from the base table. The first step is\na sequential traversal that can be sped up by pre-reading continuous\nB+ tree leaf nodes. And the second step is likely to be a series of\nrandom accesses, and can be optmized by BKP.\nWe implement BKP in our storage engine, the interface of BKP\naccepts a group of keys to be prefetched. When the interface is\ncalled, the engine will start a background prefetching task, retrieves\nrequired keys from the target index and fetches corresponding data\npages from the remote memory/storage when necessary.\nBKP can also optimize analytical workloads. For TPC-H queries,\nfor example, many of the joins are equal join with indexes, especially\nfor very large tables. When dealing with these huge tables or the\ntable data is cold, a large number of pages may need to be fetched\nfrom the remote. BKP can be used to speed up equal joins that\naccess the inner table with index. In MySQL, there is a join buffer\nwhich accumulates the interesting columns of rows produced by\nthe left join operand. Tables from earlier joins are read in portions\ninto the join buffer, when the number of rows in the join buffer\nreaches a threshold, BKP will build and send a batch of keys to the\nstorage engine to prefetch pages of the inner table. Concurrently,\nthe storage engine prefetches the pages containing these keys in\nthe background. When the join buffer is full, the rows in the buffer\nwill be joined with the inner table, at this point, we expect that\nmost pages needed should have already be loaded into the cache.\n5 RELIABILITY AND FAILURE RECOVERY\nInPolarDB Serverless , the disaggregated architecture allows nodes\nof each type to failover independently. Therefore, we tailor the\nfailure recovery method for each node type. Most recovery methods\nfollow approaches in existing PolarDB design. All proxy nodes in\nPolarDB Serverless are stateless. When a proxy node fails, it can be\neasily replaced. User connections can reconnect to other alive nodes.\nPolarDB Serverless maintains at least 2 replicas for each storage node\n(i.e., 3 replica in total). Each group of replicas is managed by the\ndistributed consensus protocol, Parallel Raft. Overall, our design\nguarantees that there is no single-point failure in the system.\nIn the rest of this section, we focus on more complex mechanisms\nthat deal with database node recovery, memory node recovery and\ncluster recovery, respectively.\n5.1 Database Node Recovery\nPolarDB Serverless adopts an ARIES-style recovery algorithm [ 33].\nRW and RO nodes have different recovery procedures. A failed\nRO node can be easily replaced with a new one using pages in the\nshared memory. Based on whether the node failure is planned or\nnot, the recovery process is different.\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n2484Unplanned Node Failure When the RW node fails, the Cluster\nManager (CM) detects this event via heartbeat signals (usually\nworking at 1Hz) and initiates a RO node promotion process. The\nsteps are as follows:\n(1)CM notifies all memory and storage nodes to refuse subse-\nquent write requests from the original RW node.\n(2)CM selects a RO node ( RW\u2032) and informs it to make the\npromotion.\n(3)RW\u2032collects the latest version ( LSN chunk ) from each Po-\nlarFS page chunk, and gets min{LSN chunk}, which is the\ncheckpoint version LSN cp.\n(4)RW\u2032then reads the redo log records persisted on PolarFS log\nchunks, starting from LSN cpto the end of redo log LSN tail,\nand distributes them to page chunks, waiting for page chunks\nto consume these redo records and complete the recovery.\n(5)RW\u2032scans the remote memory pool, evicts pages whose\ninvalidation bit is 1, and pages whose version ( LSN pa\u0434e) is\nnewer than the version of redo ( LSN tail).\n(6)RW\u2032releases all PL locks obtained by the original RW node.\n(7)RW\u2032scans undo headers to construct the state of all active\ntransactions at the moment the original RW node fails.\n(8)RW\u2032is ready to receive write requests, after it notifies CM\nthe promotion completes RW\u2032becomes the new RW node.\n(9)RW\u2032plays undo logs to rollback uncommitted transactions\nin the background.\nStep (3) and (4) are performing the REDO phase in the ARIES-\nstyle recovery procedure [ 33]. The difference is that REDO is no\nlonger executed on a single machine, but concurrently executed on\nmany page chunk nodes, which speeds up the REDO phase. Step\n(5) evicts the pages from the remote memory, whose version is\ninconsistent with the stored versions in the remote storage, which\nrelies on the property described in Section 3.1.4: the version of a\npage with the invalidation bit of 0 in the remote memory cannot\nbe lower than that in the storage. On the other hand, because RW\nmay already write back dirty pages to the remote memory before\nthe redo logs are flushed to PolarFS, some pages in the remote\nmemory may be more advanced than the persisted state in PolarFS.\nTherefore, these pages also need to be cleared. After step (3) (4)\n(5), redo logs in PolarFS, pages in PolarFS, and pages in the remote\nmemory are completely consistent. In step (6), because RW uses PL\nlocks to protect the SMO and all page modifications of a SMO are\npacked into one MTR, all modifications of a SMO are written as an\natomic operation. After step (3) (4) (5), the state of the database is\nrestored to a consistent status, so there is no SMO in progress at this\ntime, thus all PL locks can be released safely. Since most active data\npages still reside in the remote memory pool, the cold cache issue in\ntraditional master-slave replication architecture is prevented. Note\nthat parallel redo recovery is a well known technique [ 8,22,43].\nHowever, integrating it with disaggregated memory and storage\nrequires nontrivial engineering effort.\nPlanned Node Down When the RW node is planned to be\ndown, it will perform a series of cleanup work to reduce the work-\nload of the new RW node to take over. For example, synchronize\nredo logs to the page chunk, actively release all PL locks, and write\ndirty pages back to remote memory, finally flush redo logs to Po-\nlarFS. In this way, the new RW node can save step (4) (5) (6) whenrecovering. In addition, the new node can choose to delay its pro-\nmotion until the moment when the number of active transactions\nis low, which will further reduce the cost of step (7) and (9). To-\ngether with techniques discussed in Section 3.5, operations such as\nupgrades and migrations will have less impact on the application.\n5.2 Memory Node Recovery\nMemory nodes caches buffered pages used by databases. Logs are\nalways flushed to the storage before dirty pages are written to mem-\nory nodes. Therefore when a memory node is down, the buffered\npages can always be recovered from the storage.\nRecall that the memory node containing the first slab is called\nhome node (Section 3.1). This node contains the critical control\nmetadata such as PAT, PIB, PRD and PLT. The control metadata is\nessential to the database normal activities, since it contains critical\ninformation to ensure cross-node consistency. Under this consid-\neration, home node\u2019s metadata is also backed up in another \u201cslave\nreplica\u201d in a synchronized manner. The home node is responsible\nfor detecting slab node failures. In the case of slab node failures,\nthe home node will go over the PAT and process all buffered pages\noriginally registered under those slab nodes. These buffer pages\nwill be re-registered by fetching them from RW\u2019s local cache or just\ncalling page_unregister to remove them.\n5.3 Cluster Recovery\nIn rare cases, when all replicas of the home node are unavailable, the\nservice needs to be recovered through cluster recovery. All database\nnodes and memory nodes will be restarted from the cleared state,\nand all memory states are rebuilt from storage. After initialization\n(attach to remote memory and storage, etc.), the RW node performs\nthe parallel REDO recovery as described in Section 5.1, and then\nscans the undo header to find all uncompleted transactions. Af-\nter that, the RW node starts services and rollbacks uncommitted\ntransactions in the background. In the cluster recovery, the pages\ncached in the remote memory is cleared, so it will endure the cold\ncache problem.\n6 EVALUATION\n6.1 Experiment Setup\nIn this section, we evaluate the elasticity, availability, and perfor-\nmance of PolarDB Serverless . For performance evaluation, we use\nstandard benchmarks including sysbench [ 23], TPC-C [ 12] and\nTPC-H [ 37] for both transactional and analytical workloads. We\ndeploy database instances in dockers of version 17.06.2 and use\ncgroup to vary the configuration from 8 CPUs to 32 CPUs, and 8\nGB to 500 GB memories. These dockers are deployed in a cluster\ncontaining 32 machines, connected by a high-speed RDMA network\nusing Mellanox ConnectX-4 network adaptor. The OS we use is\nLinux 3.10.\n6.2 Elasticity of the Disaggregated Memory\nElasticity is one of key advantages of PolarDB Serverless . In Fig-\nure 8, we report the overall throughput (sysbench oltp_read_only\nwith range select) of a PolarDB Serverless instance. In 200, 350, 500\nseconds, the remote memory size of the instance increased from\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n248500.20.40.60.811.21.41336597129161193225257289321353385417449481513545577609641673705737769QPS (thousands)Time (s)8 GB80 GB48 GB128 GBFigure 8: Throughput of PolarDB Serverless while scaling out-\n/in the remote memory (i.e., 8GB, 80GB, 48GB, 128GB) while\nprocessing range queries.\n8GB to 80GB, 48GB and 128GB respectively. This test simulates\nthe scenario where customers use PolarDB Serverless on a pay-as-\nyou-go basis. It can be seen from the measured throughput that\nafter each memory expansion operation, the performance gradu-\nally improves, because the newly added slabs take some time to\nbe warmed. After each memory shrink operation, the performance\nwill drop immediately, as slabs and pages are removed from the\nremote buffer pool at once. With such elasticity, customers can\nexpand remote memory to almost unlimited capacity, and only pay\nfor the necessary resources for achieving performance targets.\n6.3 Fast Failover\nFigure 9 shows the trend of throughput during a RW node is re-\ncovering from either a planned switch (switching RW during auto-\nscaling) or an unplanned failure. It takes only 6 seconds (pause for\n2s and another 4s to resume throughput) for the RW in PolarDB\nServerless to fully recover from a planned switch. For unplanned\nfailures, we compare the recovery of PolarDB Serverless in different\ncases: (1) with the remote memory and all optimizations (blue line),\n(2) without the remote memory but with page materialization (yel-\nlow line), and (3) without page materialization (orange line). The\nremote memory is able to keep hot pages despite the switch/crash,\nwhich avoids costly page reloading during recovery. Therefore, it\nonly takes 16 seconds for the blue line to resume the service and\nanother 7 seconds to reach its previous performance (i.e. 90% of the\npeak performance before the crash). Without the remote memory,\nalthough the RW can read materialized pages from the storage, it\ntakes extra time (12 seconds longer) to warm up the buffer pool.\nWhen materialized pages are not available, the RW has to apply\nthe redo log and reconstruct pages, taking 5.3 times longer time (or\n85 seconds) to resume the service. Finally, it spends a total of 105\nseconds to reach its previous performance.\n02040608010012016111621263136414651566166717681869196101106111116121126131136141146151156161QPS (thousands)Timestamp (seconds)Planned swtichWith remote memoryWith page mat. onlyW/o page mat.Crashed/switchedat 20sFully recoveredat 43sFully recoveredat 125sFully recoveredat 26sFully recoveredat 55s\nFigure 9: Recovery time for the RW with shared memory or\nlocal memory\n0123(LM:0.5,RM:4,M:4)(LM:4,RM:24,M:4)(LM:24,RM:24,M:24)tpmCx 10000PolarDB ServerlessPolarDB(a) TPC-C (WH = 200)\n00.511.52\nQ4Q5Q10Q12Q15Latency (seconds)x 1000PolarDB Serverless (LM:8,RM:64)PolarDB (M:64)PolarDB Serverless (LM:64,RM:256)\n(b) TPC-H (SF = 100)\nFigure 10: Performance comparison with PolarDB.

In Figure 10(a) and 10(b),\nwe compare the performance of PolarDB Serverless and PolarDB us-\ning TPC-C and TPC-H, respectively. In these figures, Mrepresents\nthe memory size for PolarDB, LMandRMare local and remote mem-\nory size for PolarDB Serverless ,DSis the data size of TPC-C/TPC-H\nworkloads. The unit of memory size is GB.\nWe first compare the performance of TPC-C under three differ-\nent pairs of configurations. (1) When PolarDB\u2019s memory size and\nPolarDB Serverless \u2019s remote memory size are configured with the\nsame size (4GB), which are smaller than the entire working set size\n(20GB). In this case, we observe that the performance of PolarDB is\nbetter because accessing local memory is faster than remote mem-\nory. (2) When we increase PolarDB Serverless \u2019s local memory size\nto 4GB, and PolarDB\u2019s memory size and PolarDB Serverless \u2019s local\nmemory size are equal, the performance of PolarDB Serverless is\nsuperior to PolarDB since accessing data from shared memory is\nfaster than from shared storage. (3) Finally, when both PolarDB\u2019s\nbuffer pool and PolarDB Serverless \u2019s local memory are large enough\n(24GB) to hold the entire dataset, their performance is close. Next,\nwe test the performance of TPC-H under two similar scenarios\nwhere PolarDB\u2019s memory is configured as same as PolarDB Server-\nless\u2019s local or remote memory size. We collect similar observations\nas above test. In summary, PolarDB Serverless offers cloud customers\na more elastic (scalable and tunable) way of using databases at a\nreasonable performance loss, compared with the conventional Po-\nlarDB. In the following, we show that the performance of PolarDB\nServerless scales well when more resources are provisioned.\nEffect of local memory size. We evaluate the performance\neffect of the database node\u2019s local memory capacity using sysbench,\nTPC-C and TPC-H respectively. These results demonstrate that the\nperformance penalty of memory disaggregation is acceptable and\ntunable.\nIndustrial Track Paper\n \nSIGMOD \u201921, June 20\u201325, 2021, Virtual Event, China\n2486020406080\n0102030405060\n0.5124824KQPS (thousands)Localmemory sizes (GB)QPSPages swapped\nNumber of pages swapped(a) Uniform distribution (sysbench)\n020406080\n0102030405060\n0.5124824KQPS (thousands)Localmemory sizes (GB)QPSPages swapped\nNumber of pages swapped (b) Skewed distribution (sysbench)\n020406080\n05101520253035\n0.5124824KtpmC (thousands)Localmemory sizes (GB)tpmCPages swapped\nNumber of pages swapped (c) TPC-C (WH = 200)\nFigure 11: Performance of mixed reads and writes with varying local memory sizes.\n0100200300400500600700\nQ2Q4Q5Q8Q10Q11Q12Q14Q15Q16Q17Q18Q19Q20Q21Q22Latency(seconds)16 GB32 GB64 GB256 GB\nFigure 12: Latency of TPC-H queries (SF = 100) with varying\ncapacities of the local cache (16 GB to 256 GB)\nFigure 11(a), 11(b) and 11(c) show the throughput of mixed reads\nand writes in addition to the number of swapped pages. We test on\nsysbench oltp_read_write benchmark using uniform and skewed2\ndistributions, as well as TPC-C queries. In all cases, we vary the\nlocal memory size from 0.5GB to 24GB. From Figure 11, we make\nthree observations: (1) The performance losses caused by page\nswapping between local and remote memory are at most 18.5%,\n10.7% and 13.4% in three cases when the local memory is as small\nas 0.5GB. (2) Since hot data pages are cached on the database node\nas the local memory capacity increases, the total amount of data\ntransferred from memory nodes to database nodes decreases signif-\nicantly, and meanwhile the system performance greatly increases.\nThe throughput increases gradually until the local memory is large\nenough to hold the entire working set, in which case there is no\npage swapping between local memory and remote memory. (3) As\nthe local memory size increases, the performance curves of skewed\ndistribution and TPC-C workload are more smooth than that of\nuniform distribution due to higher hit ratio of local memory for hot\npages.\nFigure 12 shows the measured latency of TPC-H queries with\ndifferent local cache size varied from 16 GB to 256 GB. The data size\nof TPC-H workloads is configured to SF=100 (200GB in storage).\nWe observe that the performance curve with the increase of local\nmemory size is steeper than that of sysbench. The reason is that the\ndata size of TPC-H is larger than that of sysbench, which introduces\nmore remote memory accesses with the same local memory size.\nCompared to 10 GB local memory, the latency could be reduced by\n40.9% when using 256 GB local memory to hold the entire working\nset.\nEffect of remote memory size. Next, we analyze the effects of\nshared memory size on the overall system performance. Figure 13\nevaluates the latency of TPC-H queries with different capacities\n2The skewed distribution is generated by the sysbench oltp_read_write benchmark\nwith setting \u201crand-type=default\u201d, which uses about 5% of all key IDs as hot data in\ngenerated queries.of the shared remote memory varied from 32 GB to 256 GB. The\nlocal cache size is fixed to 8 GB. We observe that the capacity of\nshared memory can have a significant effect on performance. As the\nmemory size grows from 32 GB to 128 GB, about two-thirds of TPC-\nH queries achieve speedup by 3.06x on average. This indicates that\nPolarDB Serverless can provide higher performance by expanding\nshared memory capacity. Note that the rest (Q2, Q11, Q16, Q17,\nQ19) are not sensitive to the memory capacity, since their execution\ntime is relatively short (all less than 100 seconds) and 32GB memory\nseems large enough for them.\nEffect of optimistic locking. In Figure 14, we run sysbench-\nread-write (both uniform and skew distributions) on a PolarDB\nServerless instance with one RW node and another RO node. Proxy\nwill redirect all writes to the RW node and balance the read requests\nbetween RW and RO. We compare the total read throughput using\neither the optimisitic lock (Olock) or not (Plock) when increasing\nthe number of client threads. When the number of concurrent\nthreads increases from 32 to 128, Plock loses almost 50% of its\ntotal QPS, while Olock only loses up to 10%. It shows that under\nhigh concurrency, optimistic locking significantly improves read\nperformance by reducing the cost of acquiring PL locks on RO\nnodes.\nEffect of prefetching. Figure 15(a) and 15(b) evaluate the ef-\nfects of prefetching on the measured response times of TPC-H\nqueries, when initially placing all the data in the remote memory\nor the storage, respectively. In Figure 15(b), we turn off the remote\nmemory to force cache-missed pages to be loaded from the storage,\nso that we can evaluate the effect of prefetching for remote storage.\nWe choose these queries because joins in them involve retrieving a\nlot of records from large tables (i.e., lineitem and orders) after the\ncorresponding equi-join conditions are evaluated, where BKP is\nsupposed to be effective. We make two observations: (1) The latency\ngradually decreases at 25.4% and 52.3% on average in two cases,\nbecause remote access overhead can be reduced by data prefetching.\n(2) The benefit from prefetching on remote storage is higher than\nthat on remote memory, because the I/O latency of remote storage\nis higher than remote memory.\n7 RELATED WORK\nDatabases with decoupled compute and storage.

However, tightly coupled CPU and memory re-\nsources still suffer from low resource utilization, limited elasticity\nand fate sharing.\nDatabases with remote memory. Substantial advances in high-\nspeed network push forward the development of shared-memory\n(or shared-cache) database cluster. Oracle RAC proposes the Cache\nFusion technique [ 24] that allows nodes to share the local cache with\ndata coherence through high-speed inter-node messaging. How-\never, since RAC is built on distributed cache and lock management,\nthe complexity of inter-node coordination grows exponentially as\nthe number of nodes increases. IBM\u2019s DB2 pureScale [ 6,21] utilizes\ncentralized lock management to directly access global cache using\nRDMA, which effectively simplifies read-sharing and write-sharing\npolicy. It further adopts MVCC [ 29,34] to permit that queries can\nread a slightly old but still consistent version of a record to avoid\nlocking. However, the maximum global cache capacity of pureScale\nis limited by the total memory of dedicated cluster caching facil-\nity, lacking of elasticity for on-demand cloud applications. NAM-\nDB [46] redesigns distribuetd database based on the separated archi-\ntecture of compute and memory via RDMA. It adopts a optimistic\nnative SI-Protocol, which may results in high abort rates especially\nwhen there are hot spots or slow workers.\nDatabases in disaggregated data centers. Cloud infrastruc-\nture providers now offer multi-socket servers with hundreds of\ncores and tens of TB memory. Prior work [ 1] focuses on fine-grained\nelasticity for shared-everything, scale-up OLTP systems deployed\nin such a multi-core server. [ 5] analyses in-memory DBMSs onlatest multi-socket hardware and further optimizes concurrency\ncontrol schemes. However, the maximum global memory capacity\nand CPUs are still limited by a single standalone machine.\nLegoOS [ 38] proposes an intriguing idea of replacing all hard-\nware components in a server with network-linked counterparts\nin a data center. Prior work [ 47] evaluates popular databases on\nLegoOS and concludes that simply placing databases on disaggre-\ngated OS suffers significant performance degradation from massive\nremote memory accesses. To eliminate the limited memory size in a\nsingle machine, FaRM [ 13] and INFINISWAP [ 16] propose memory\ndisaggregation schemes to provision a global memory pool to all ma-\nchines. They exploit the modern RDMA network to reduce remote\nmemory access latency by an order of magnitude, compared to that\nof those systems using TCP/IP. Prior work [ 27] leverages remote\nmemory via RDMA to accelerate memory-intensive workloads for\nexisting RDBMSs when local memory is insufficient. However, all\nschemes do not address the inter-node data consistency problem,\ndisallowing memory write-sharing among multiple machines.\nGAM [ 7] is a distributed in-memory computing platform to\nexpose a unified global memory interface. RAMCloud [ 36] is a\nlog-structured DRAM-based key-value store that keeps all data\nin DRAM at all times. It is nontrivial to build high-performance\ndatabases using GAM or RAMCloud directly. Tailored database\ndesigns and optimizations are still open to explore.\nComputation pushdown. Numerous studies have proposed\nmethods for near-data processing [ 19,20,40,45]. The key idea\nis that data should be processed at the place close to where it is\nstored to eliminate unnecessary data access and movement. Our\npast work [ 8] pushes table scan down from LSM-tree to disaggre-\ngated storage, which significantly reduces latency and storage-to-\nmemory data movement volume for TPC-H. This inspires us to\nintegrate similar techniques to the disaggregated memory, which\nis close to the area of Near-Memory Computing [28, 39].\n8 CONCLUSION\nThis paper presents PolarDB Serverless , the first cloud-native data-\nbase implementation of the disaggregation architecture. It is a fork\nof the PolarDB MySQL/InnoDB codebase. The buffer pool man-\nagement has been completely rewritten to take advantage of the\nscalable remote memory pool with a local caching tier. We have in-\ntroduced the detailed design and optimizations adopted in PolarDB\nServerless . For future work, we plan to explore offloading more\ntasks from compute nodes to remote memory to reduce cross-node\ncommunication cost, and store transactions state (such as logical\nlocks and intermediate query results) in disaggregated memory to\nimprove auto-scaling transparency.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nPolarDB Serverless benefits greatly from our clients. Their expec-\ntations for cloud-native databases have driven us to design this\ndisaggregated architecture in this work. The making of PolarDB\nServerless is a large project that is not possible without mutual ef-\nforts from multiple roles at Alibaba Cloud.

[MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is David Goggins. David Goggins is a\nretired Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's also a highly accomplished\nultramarathon runner. For those of you\nthat don't know, ultramarathons are\ndistances longer than 26 miles and, in\nDavid's case, often longer than 200 miles. For his achievements\nin athletics, he has been inducted into\nthe International Sports Hall of Fame. He also held a Guinness World\nRecord for the most pull-ups completed in 24 hours. I should mention that not only\nwas David a decorated Navy SEAL, but he also graduated\nfrom Army Ranger School. David is also a highly\nsuccessful writer, having authored two books, the\nfirst entitled \"Can't Hurt Me\" and the second entitled \"Never\nFinished,\" both of which are best sellers. David's books cover\nmany topics, including his autobiographical\ndescription of what can only be described as an\nincredibly challenging child and young adulthood. His home was abusive. His school environment\nwas abusive. He essentially had no positive\nresources directed his way and. In his 20s, he found himself\nto be obese, that is, more than 300\npounds working a job he despised for minimal pay. And it was at that point that\nDavid began an inner dialogue that forced him to explore\nthe demons born out of his childhood but also the\nposition that he found himself in as a young man and\nthen began the journey to navigate that dialogue and\ntransform himself into the Navy SEAL, the ultramarathon\nrunner, the bestselling author, and the extraordinarily\npositive and influential man that he is today. As some of you may\nknow, David has done various public lectures. He's a familiar face\nonline because there are so many clips of him on YouTube. And he has done podcasts before. However, I'm certain that\nyou'll find today's discussion to be very different\nthan previous podcasts that David has been featured on. The reason is\nthat-- of course, we get into his accomplishments. We talk about the\nmindset that allowed him to achieve those things. But, today, David really\nlets us under the hood. He lets us into the\nform of inner dialogue that he has to\nembrace, indeed that he has to grapple with on a daily\nbasis, sometimes multiple times throughout the day\nand night in order to impose the sort\nof self-discipline that he is so well known for. We also get into some of\nthe scientific mechanisms underlying willpower. And we talk about\nDavid's current endeavors that include, for instance,\nhis own exploration of science and medicine for which he\nhas become an intense scholar and practitioner. I should mention that multiple\ntimes throughout today's discussion you will\nhear curse words. Now David and I both\nacknowledge that cursing isn't for everybody\nand that cursing itself is different than\ncursing at somebody. Nonetheless, we do realize\nthat many people, parents perhaps especially, might\nnot want to hear cursing. If you don't want\nto hear cursing, well, then this podcast episode\nis probably not for you. However, if you are\ncomfortable with cursing or if you can tolerate\nit, I assure you today's discussion\nis highly worthwhile. Before we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part\nof my desire and effort to bring zero cost to\nconsumer information about science and\nscience-related tools to the general public. In keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast. Our first sponsor\nis Maui Nui Venison. Maui Nui Venison is the most\nnutrient dense and delicious red meat available. I've spoken before\non this podcast and there's general consensus\nthat most people should strive to consume approximately\n1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Now when one strives\nto do that, it's important to maximize the\nquality of that protein intake to the calorie ratio\nbecause you don't want to consume an\nexcess of calories when trying to get\nthat 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Maui Nui Venison has an\nextremely high quality protein to calorie ratio. So it makes getting that 1\ngram of protein per pound of body weight extremely easy. It's also delicious. Personally, I like\nthe ground venison. I also like the venison steaks. And then for convenience\nwhen I'm on the road, I like the jerky. The jerky has a very high\nprotein to calorie ratio. So it has as much as 10 grams\nof protein per jerky stick, and it has something\nlike only 55 calories, so, again, making\nit very easy to get enough protein without\nconsuming excess calories.

Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by AeroPress. AeroPress is similar to a\nFrench press for making coffee, but it is, in fact, a much\nbetter way to make coffee. I first learned about AeroPress\nwell over 10 years ago. And I've been using\none ever since. AeroPress was developed\nby Alan Adler, who was an engineer at Stanford. And I knew of Alan\nbecause he had also built the so-called Aerobie\nFrisbee, which I believe at one time, perhaps\nstill now, held the Guinness Book\nof World Records for furthest thrown object. And I used to see Alan,\nbelieve it or not, at parks around Palo Alto\ntesting out different Aerobie Frisbees. So he was sort of\nfamous in our community for developing these\ndifferent feats of engineering that turned into\ncommercial products. Now I love coffee. I'm somebody that drinks coffee\nnearly every day, usually about 90 to 120\nminutes after I wake up in the morning,\nalthough not always. Sometimes if I'm\ngoing to exercise, I'll drink coffee first\nthing in the morning. But I love, love, love coffee. And what I've personally found\nis that by using the AeroPress, I can make the best possible\ntasting cup of coffee. I don't know what exactly\nit is in the AeroPress that allows the same\nbeans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes\nthat much better as compared to any other form of\nbrewing that coffee, even the traditional French press. The AeroPress is\nextremely easy to use. And it's extremely compact. In fact, I take it with\nme whenever I travel. And I use it on the road,\nin hotels, even on planes. I'll just ask for\nsome hot water, and I'll brew my coffee or\ntea right there on the plane. If you'd like to try\nAeroPress, you can go to aeropress.com/huberman. That's A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S dotcom\nslash Huberman to get 20% off any aeropress coffeemaker. AeroPress ships anywhere\nin the USA, Canada, and over 60 other\ncountries around the world. Again, that's\naeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off. Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've spoken many times\nbefore on this podcast about the fact that\nsleep is the foundation of mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance. Now a key component of\ngetting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall\nand stay deeply asleep, your body temperature\nactually has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized, your body temperature\nactually has to increase by about\n1 to 3 degrees. One of the best ways to make\nsure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate\ntimes, at the beginning and throughout and at the end\nof your night when you wake up, is to control the temperature\nof your sleeping environment. And that's what Eight\nSleep allows you to do. It allows you to program the\ntemperature of your mattress and sleeping environment\nsuch that you fall and stay deeply asleep\neasily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly\nrefreshed and energized. I've been sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress cover for almost\nthree years now. And it has dramatically improved\nthe quality of my sleep. If you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep, you can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman to get $150 off their Pod\n3 mattress cover. Eight Sleep currently\nships in the USA, Canada, UK, select countries\nin the EU, and Australia. Again, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman. And now for my discussion\nwith David Goggins. David Goggins, welcome. DAVID GOGGINS: My man. Good to see you again, man. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nGreat to see you. It was late 2016,\nearly 2017, I believe, when you were in\nmy lab at Stanford. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes sir. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We did a\nlittle work later that day down in San Jose. And, gosh, see you everywhere,\nbut it's not enough. So great to have you here. DAVID GOGGINS: Thanks for\nhaving me on, brother. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. You embody discipline\nand doing hard things. I think we should just\nstart right off with-- DAVID GOGGINS: Yeah. Let's just go there. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--the bold truth. But right before\nwe went hot mics, we were talking about learning. Right now, you're spending some\ntime learning and doing things that I think most people\nprobably don't typically associate David Goggins with. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why don't\nyou tell us about that? DAVID GOGGINS: Well,\nmost people just look at me as the guy that\nruns and yells as he's running. While I do that to\nmotivate people, but people don't understand\nthat my day is broken up into segments. I work out. I eat. I sleep, but I spend\nmost of my time studying. So like I'm in\nthe medical world. I'm a paramedic in Canada. But I spend a lot\nof my time trying to nuke every single thing\nabout it because I'm not trying to just be a\nparamedic, learn about veins, and arteries, and how the heart\npumps, and stuff like that. I'm trying to learn\nto the point where I can save someone's life. And even though paramedics are\ndoing that all over the world, I'm trying to be that\nparamedic that can really dissect exactly what's going on\nand figure out what medication goes where, just trying to\nlearn the algorithm of what's going on, man. So I spent a lot\nof time with it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nlove the word algorithm because when I teach\nbiology or try and learn anything that's related\nto biology and especially the human body, I need\nto know the nouns. But it's the verbs that matter. And that's really what\nyou're talking about. Just saying that sits there,\nthat brain part there, doesn't tell you how\nit all works together. So what does your process\nfor studying look like? If we dropped a\ncamera in the room, brought a microphone into\nyour inner dialogue-- gosh, wouldn't we all love that. But if we dropped a microphone\ninto your inner dialogue, are you waking up looking\nat the books and going, yeah, fresh day, let's learn or\nis some of the same resistance that you've talked about\ncoming up around physical work, is that coming up\nfrom time to time? DAVID GOGGINS: You know\nwhat, I was nervous at first. I'm going to keep it real. I'm going to keep it real. So I'm not a real smart guy. And what I mean by that is\nI was born with ADD, ADHD. Like my brain cannot\nretain information. I'm not some genetic freak\nwhen it comes to running, when it comes to\nlifting weights. I am absolutely the\nbottom of the barrel. And people will\nnever believe me. And they can just whatever. Believe what you\nwant to believe. So when you ask me this question\nabout what does studying look like for me, I have to go over\nthe same page over, and over, and over, and over again, while\nJennifer can look at that page while she's quizzing me,\nshe'll learn it right then as she's-- she didn't\nknow anything about it. She will quiz herself\nor quiz me and learn it as she's quizzing me. It's the most frustrating\nthing in the world how my brain works. So what I do is I literally\nsit there with a pen and paper. And I have my books. And I go through and\nhave to write everything down every single day. I will study the\nsame page until it's photographic memory from\nwriting the same thing down. And then from there, I'll go\nback through and relearn it again. So I'll learn the bulk of it. But then I'll go through\nand learn the small things within that. So if it's a medication, I'll\nlearn what the medication does. First, I'll learn\nhow to even say the medication because\nthese medications aren't like albuterol. No, it's very big words. So I'll go through, learn\nhow to say the name. Then I'll go through\nlearn what the dose is. Then I'll go through-- and\nthis is like every single day. So it's not like, oh, I got it. Let's just go through--\nno, nothing is I got it. Every single thing--\nso I can't wait to get in this conversation\nbecause everything I do in life, it sucks. Everything I do\nin life, it sucks. That's why when I was 300\npounds and 24 years old, it wasn't like I had some\nbig epiphany of let's just go be a Navy SEAL, and\nlet's lose some weight. No, I knew my entire\nlife was going to be a struggle, which\nis why I just ignored it. And I said, I'm not even trying\nto jump off any of this shit and learn how to read, how\nto write, how to memorize, how to become\nsomething I am not. But through that process,\nsomething happened to me. And I realized-- this is\nwhy I feel sorry for no one. In this podcast, they're\ngoing to really not like me because people\nare going to think that I am maybe lying or\nmaybe fibbing or exaggerating. No, I am literally-- I was the lowest form on Earth,\nno talent, no ability to learn. And I literally know what\nit is to be rock bottom and to build that up. So that question about\nlearning is the pain in my ass. And I don't have to do it. Just think about it. I'm 49 years old, and\nI'm a multi-millionaire. I don't have to do anything. So all I thought about\nwhen I was growing up is, man, I can't wait to\none day get to the point where I no longer\nhave to do this stuff. But what happened\nas I got older, it became a way of living. So how I do every day\nis how I do every day. It's a discipline. It's a regimen. It was a choice I made. And the choice I made was what\nare you willing to sacrifice, and what are you willing to\ngive up to find every bit of who you are as a human being? And I was willing to give\nup everything to do that. So studying is no joke. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love\nthat you're studying. I recall a few years ago, I\nheard some interview or podcast with you. And you just threw out like I\ndon't know what I'll do next. Maybe I'll be a scientist. And I went yeah. Because I knew-- because\nI know you a bit. And I see your work\nout there, but we had met before,\nthat if you decided that you were going to do it-- and learning medicine,\nwhich is what you're doing, learning human physiology\nis so detailed. DAVID GOGGINS: Very. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd people out there have to understand when\nyou look at a textbook and you see the veins and the\ncapillaries different colors, when the body is open,\nthey're not different colors. DAVID GOGGINS:\nRight, right, right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nI mean, some things have different color\ncontrasts, but it's not like it's all labeled\nwhen you pop it open. DAVID GOGGINS: Exactly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so the\nprocess of writing things down by hand is important for you. So you go back and\nread those notes. Do you think about\nthat stuff on your runs too or are you\nsegmenting your day like when you're done studying,\nare you heading out for a run and thinking about other things? Or are you still rehearsing\nthe material in your head? DAVID GOGGINS: So when I write\nit down, I write it down, and I'm able to-- I'm actually looking\ndown at this table right now because\nI'm back to writing. So I'm actually there right\nnow as I'm speaking to you. I write it down in a way\nthat I'm memorizing page 69. So I'm writing it down. So then writing it down and that\npage sync together in my brain. So I'm looking at the book\nin my brain right now. That's just how it works for me. And I have to do it\nover and over again. So that page is\nstuck in my mind. So I'm literally\nflipping through pages as I'm taking these tests. And I'm taking these national\ntests to become a paramedic or become an advanced\nEMT or whatever. I'm literally as I'm taking\nthat test I'm going through. And I'm like-- now I'm\nflipping pages in my head where that page was. And how I do that is\njust from how I write it and how it's on the page. When I run, I can't\nrecall any of it. I cannot bring any of\nthat because I'm running. How my mind is wired now is that\neverything I do is what I do. Because the focus it takes for\nme to-- right now, I'm running. I'm not like a great runner. I'm not like injury free. So like my first 20 minutes\nof the run I'm limping. I'm literally\nlimping because I've had several knee surgeries. And my body was twisted. And so now it's untwisting. So people look at me, oh, looks,\nlike he's limping when he runs. I am limping when I run. My body is jacked\nup so I'm focusing on how to get the best\nout of a broken body. So everything I do\nis a total focus on what I'm doing at\nthat point in my life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it\nseems like you've really trained away or somehow\ngotten away from the ADD that you mentioned\nbecause what you described is like a deep trench. It's like a V shaped trench. I'm imagining like\nthere's a ball bearing, and it's like, phewp, and it can\nonly go forward in that trench or back. And it goes forward. It's not like sliding around\nat the concave at the bottom, zip-zip-zip, like a tension. So it's like you\ntrained that up. Is there a similar\nfeeling when you're in the full focus of running\nversus full focus of studying? Does it kind of\nfeel like, oh yeah, that's the same groove but\ndifferent thing or is it just completely different world? DAVID GOGGINS: It's a\ncompletely different world. Both of them for\nme is suffering, but it's suffering a\nwhole different way. Like when I was going through\nschool, I never forget-- I think I was in third grade. And back then, ADD, ADHD,\nwasn't like here's this medicine or here's this thing. They want to put you\nin a special school. So for me, I was so\nfar behind in learning that their big thing\nwas let's just put him in a special school\nbecause he'll never learn. And through that\nprocess of like I don't want to be in\na special school, I don't want to be treated\nany differently, it really-- like I never took medication. I've never taken\nmedication for this. That's why right now you see\nme looking right in your eyes. What the hell is Huberman\nsaying right now. And that's why I don't feel\nbad for people who have ADHD, who have learning disabilities. And some are impossible\nbecause you just can't. But a lot of them you can. But people don't want to go\nthrough the process of focus, of teaching yourself\nhow to truly focus. This is where my\nmessage gets lost. It gets lost because I may\nsay MF or F because that's the passion that\ncomes out of me. It takes everything for\nme to learn a sentence. So when I speak\nabout David Goggins, I can't speak about David\nGoggins in a way that's just calm and cool. Because when I wake\nup, I know the journey that it takes for me\nto find my greatness. And it's hard. Nothing is easy. Nothing just like, oh, I\nwake up, and I just do this or I do that or it just--\nno, I watch people every day go through life,\nand it's so easy. For me to be where I'm at\ntoday, it takes every bit of me. So when I speak about it,\nand as I get going here, you'll start seeing me--\nthe tempo will rise. The passion will come out\nbecause I'm back there. I'm doing what I do every\nday to become a human being. And so nothing is easy. Like running is running. It sucks. But you have a choice to make. Do you want to sit down and go\nback to that guy you once were? No. So this is what it takes. It takes that\nmisunderstanding of people. And they'll never get it because\nthey were never David Goggins. So that is what it takes\nfor me to do what I do. It may take you\nsomething differently. So for me, everything\nhas to be in the study. Everything has to be into this. Everything has to\nbe in-- everywhere I am it has to be there,\nme, focused where I am. That's why you're\nmy second podcast I've done since Rogan,\nsince the book came out. I don't have time for that shit\nbecause if I want to be great, I'm not trying to maximize money\nor maximize people knowing me. I do these things because\nmaybe someone out there will understand me and get it and\nsay, I can grow from this guy, and others just won't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds\nlike friction is something you're very familiar with. It's a word just I feel\nlike is like cast above us right now in bold face,\nhighlighted, underlined letters. DAVID GOGGINS:\nFriction is growth. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Friction,\nlike you're up in the morning. And I imagine David Goggins\ngoing to the coffee maker, stretching out, good\nmorning, sunshine. And you're telling me from\neyelids open there's friction. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes, and that\nis the thing that people don't-- they don't fucking get. The biggest misunderstanding\nabout David Goggins of all time-- it's like whether you\nbelieve in God or not-- I do-- he put this lab rat,\nwhich is me, on this planet and said let me fucking\nsee what a beat up, abused kid who can barely\nlearn, barely learn, who has a twisted body, messed\nup genetics, sickle cell, this and that, let me\ngive him everything that pretty much disqualifies\nyou from the military. But back then, it wasn't as--\nand let's put him in this and see what comes out of it. So to do that, friction-- you don't wake up\nin the morning time and go to the coffee maker. Matter of fact, sometimes\nyou don't even sleep. What it requires\nis when I'm at-- 2 o'clock-- it's 2\no'clock in the morning. And my brain is thinking\nabout a fucking drug. And I got to get up\nand look in my book to see what that drug\nis, how I remember it. And this is every day\nof my fucking life. That's why when I train a\nfighter or I train someone, I'm like, you have no fucking\nidea how great you really are because you are\nusing such minimal, minimal of what you have. And if people can learn to\nfocus, this is what's possible. While it may not\nbe pretty-- like people want to do a\ndocumentary on me. I go no. I don't want to do\na documentary on me because I will have normal\neveryday people picking me apart. Oh, his life is miserable. Who wants to live like that? It's crazy how he-- it's\nalmost like he's sick. He's psychotic. The most frustrating\nthing in the world for me is when normal people\njudge a man like myself on what it really takes to\nextract greatness from nothing. It takes every bit of who you\nare if you choose that route. If you don't, Merry Christmas,\ndo what you got to do. But, yeah, all these\nthings for me-- like I told you, man, I'm\ngoing to keep it real. I'm not coming here to talk\nabout perform without purpose because I go through-- when I write these\nbooks, I go through, I try to dumb down\nDavid Goggins. How can I give normal\npeople-- and I'm normal. But I found something that\nmost don't want to find. How can I speak to\npeople and give them something from this crazy\npsychotic brain that I've developed? How can I give them that? So I sit down with\nJennifer for years and write down perform\nwithout purpose, callus your mind, armor\nyour mind, the cookie jar, the accountability mirror, shit\nthat people can fucking use in their lives. No, no, I'm glad it helps you. But the barbaric life that I\nlive that you have to live, the almost obsession that\nyou must have to be great, you can't put that shit\nin a fucking book, bro. You can't put in a book. You can't. You can't write about it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nhas to be experienced. DAVID GOGGINS: It has\nto be experienced. And you can't even-- after you experience it,\nto write it in the book, it would seem like he\nneeds to be locked up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Too gory. DAVID GOGGINS: It's too gory. Doesn't make sense for\na guy that everything, every second of the\nday he is trying to extract more from something. He's constantly thinking. He's constantly,\nconstantly disciplined, never going off the path. Whatever is injured on\nhim, he figures away. It's a conquerors mindset. And very few people, if any, can\nreally understand what that is. Like I'm almost 50. And I've been this way\nfor almost 30 years. Like what do you do for fun? These questions,\nI don't get them. I don't understand them. I don't-- so yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I get\nasked that sometimes, what do you do for fun. I start listing off all this\nstuff like podcasting, reading, working out. So some of that resonates. But I think what's so\ntruly unusual about what you're describing, your process\nis that from go it's hard. And I have to ask was being 300\npounds, having essentially-- I'm using the words\nyou've described. DAVID GOGGINS: No, do it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou've said it before. You had a tendency at one\npoint in your life early on tell lies, try and\nget people's approval. DAVID GOGGINS: Lied my ass off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Crazy\nhaircuts, attention seeking, and yet all of that\ntriggered something that now is extraordinary. Do you think those\nhardships were necessary to flip the switch? DAVID GOGGINS: I don't know\nif they were necessary, but it was something\nthat made me feel-- I didn't feel good. It was easy. The brain that I was\ngiven as a child, it was easy to go\nhome and think about, how do I want to\nbe a freak today? How do I want to show up to\nschool today and be a freak? It didn't require me going home\nand opening a book up saying, it's going to take me all year\nto learn this fucking page. So instead of\nlearning that page, I learned how to\nbecome a character. And maybe that character\nthat I created, that 300 pound,\ninsecure guy that used to fake it till\nI make it type of guy, let me become your\nfriend, let me lie to you until you like me type of guy-- when you have any manhood,\nwomanhood, a human being, a soul, a spirit, any-- I must have just this much\npride because that's exactly what opened the door for me. Because every day,\nyou were a character. Every day, you were a clown. Every day, you opened that\nSpanish book or that science book or English book,\nand you looked at it. It looked like a\nforeign language. And you're saying,\nwhere do I start? Where do I start? And, obviously,\nit was necessary. The more I talk about it, it\nwas necessary because what happened is I became\nhaunted by the mere fact that this is my existence. And you got to live with that. And I lived with it\nfor a lot of years. And so I sat back and\nsaid, OK, all right, I know what this takes. And when you sit back,\nas fucked up as I was-- and I had a laundry\nlist, a table like this of what I\nhave to do to become just a human being that\ncan make ends meet, that can make $1,000 a month. Just to get there was like,\noh my god, dude, like how-- I'm 16, 17, I can't read. I can't write. Oh my god, I'm so\nbehind the power curve. And my brain is about\nbeing depressed. And my dad beat--\nmy mom's not home. And kids are calling\nme nigger at school. And I'm like, oh my god,\nman, what the fuck do I do? And it wasn't like someone\ncame around and said, hey, man, you can do this. This is all me. Some people want to know where\ndoes this cold man come from. I'm not trying to be cold. It's the reality of my life. It's the reality of a\nlot of people's lives. And so, yeah, that had to\nhappen for me to be haunted, to be haunted, to\npull out, to extract the guy that I am today. That haunting is something\nthat's still there today because no matter\nhow much you improve, no matter how much you\nchange who you are, it's not permanent. You don't just wake up\nand say, oh my god, man, you're David Goggins. You break records. You do this. You do that. People want to know, how are\nyou able to just be so hard? Because I never turn\nthe fucking thing off. Because once it turns\noff, I go right back to the David Goggins that is. And that's the guy that I'm\nconstantly fighting every day. And it's a choice. And that choice makes\nyou misunderstood. It makes you crazy. That's why I hate\nfucking social media. In 2013, people wanted\nme to write my book. I did it in 2018. Took five years. And the reason why\nI didn't do it-- I sat at the table,\nand Jennifer was there. This was before she\nstarted working for me, I started dating\nher or whatever. And all these people were there. And they're like, man, you\ngot to go on social media. And I was like, fuck you, man. It's poison. It's poison because I knew\nwhat I did to get where I am. And I'm going to\nhave these people, these normal, everyday\npeople, fat, lazy, exactly who I was judging me. Because I know it\nbecause I was once them. All my hard work,\nall my dedication, I'm going to have\nsome normal dude get his little brownie, his little\nDing Dong, Ho Ho, Twinkie, sit there with his\ncoffee picking me apart. Oh, he must be unhappy. Do you know how hard it\nis to put these shoes on every damn morning? And I'm gonna have\nyou pick me apart? So, yeah, there's so\nmuch that goes into this that I was like fuck this. I never wanted\nanything to do with it. So anyway. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nnot a psychologist. But knowing your story\nfrom what you've written, what you've said\non social media, and elsewhere, podcasts and\nhere now especially, it's amazing to me, and,\nfrankly, it pulls at my heartstrings\na little bit I realize that's not what\nyou're trying to do but that in the course of your\nchildhood and in your young adulthood that no one ever\ngot between you and the world. I forget where I heard it\nthat if a kid has just one person that believes in them-- and I had my trials\nand tribulations. But I had great\ncoaches, great mentors. I attached to them. I found them if they\ndidn't necessarily find me. But I'm realizing that your\nsituation was no one's ever said, hey, I'm going to\nstand here next to you or get in front of\nyou, put a shield up. And so it's almost like\nyou've got these different-- it's all you, but there's\nversions of yourself-- that like you knew social\nmedia-- like I don't know that I have the wherewithal\nin 2013 '14, '15, '16, '17 to get in front\nof myself while doing all this because I've already\ngot so much going on in here. Is that about right? DAVID GOGGINS: That is right. But I had developed\na lot of anger. And I still have it. And it will never go away\nfor the normal human beings of this world because when\nyou put yourself in the sewer like I was in-- and please,\nif someone saved me, come out and announce\nit to the world. There was no one. There's no one. So when you know that-- and then I'm\nsitting at the table with all these smart\npeople who are telling me what to do and shit and\nguiding me through my life now when I'm 40\nfucking years old. It's 2000-- I don't know\n40-something years old. Now I'm 49. And I'm looking at them all. And they're now\ntrying to guide me on what's right on this poison. And so, yeah, what\nyou say is right. But for me, it was\nmore of I know now. I don't need you\nto guide my future. I know what's good for\nme and what's bad for me. And for me, it took every\nbit of focus I could. And I know social media-- that's why people love to go on\nthere because they want to show you the good side of life. I'm not teaching\ngood side of life. So I had to figure\nout a way when I came on 2016 of teaching\nyou what life really is for the majority of us is hell. And so while people love to show\nyou the cars, and the house, and the vacations and\nshit, all that's good. All that's happy. I'm going to show you the\nside that I know most of you are going through. And people hide very well. I don't want to hide anymore. I hid it for 24 fucking years. So that's why now\nwhen I told you we can talk about\nwhatever you want because as human beings, the\nfirst thing we have to learn-- I also stuttered\nreal bad growing up. So if you hear me stutter\nevery now and then, it's because that was\npart of my life also. So it's funny. Human beings want to\nshow you the best side. And they want to\nhide the worst side. For me, I'm going\nto teach you how to be vulnerable because that's\nthe only way you fix yourself. You don't fix yourself\nby coming out here and me selling you\nsome fucking books. That's why I don't have them. I forgot them. I'm glad people got\nsomething from the book. I want you to learn that\nthe only way you grow is how to look at\nyourself and say, OK, like I did, table longer than\nthis, what the fuck I have to do to get somewhere? There was nothing good\non there, nothing. Yeah, I loved\nplaying basketball. I left that out. That's something I love to do. I don't care about that. That didn't make\nthe fucking list because the list\nthat I had to live by was the very list that was\ngoing to get me at this table with you to talk to you to\nthe normal human beings, which I once was, about how you can\nget somewhere and how it looks. It looks very ugly. There's no fucking passion. There's no fucking motivation. There's no, oh my\ngod, man, I fucking-- no, it's every day of\nyour life just doing, no passion, no discipline, no\nmotivation, all these words. I hate that so many people\nfucking use these words now because it's watered. Someone sitting in\nthe room by themselves and they figure themselves\nout and say, god, this is going to fucking suck. Where's passion when\nyou're 300 pounds? Where's the motivation when\nyou can't read and write? Where is it? So how did this happen? I just fucking did. I just did. I said maybe at the\nend of this journey, there will be\nsomething there for me. If not, I can read. If not, I'm 185 fucking pounds. There was no magic potion. There was no, oh, let me wake\nup and look at some shit. No. All those words are overused. They're bullshit. It's all bullshit. Just do. You're living. How do you want to live? How do you want to die? How do you want to\nfucking be remembered? That's it. That's it. Period. ANDREW HUBERMAN: As\nmany of you know, I've been taking AG1\ndaily since 2012. So I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast. AG1 is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all\nof your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get\nenough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole foods\nsources that include vegetables and fruits every day. But, oftentimes, I simply\ncan't get enough servings. But with AG1, I'm sure to get\nenough vitamins, and minerals, and the probiotics that I need. And it also contains adaptogens\nto help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel\nbetter when I take AG1. I have more focus and\nenergy, and I sleep better. And it also happens\nto taste great. For all these\nreasons, whenever I'm asked if you could take just\none supplement what would it be, I answer AG1. If you'd like to try AG1, go to\ndrinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you\nfive free travel packs plus a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3, K2. Again, that's\ndrinkag1.com/huberman. The word haunted is\nringing in my head. DAVID GOGGINS: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nit's such a powerful word. DAVID GOGGINS: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBecause I was about to m it seems like a huge part\nof your process, maybe the entire process, is\nit's all stick no carrot, you talk about the carrot,\nthe positive thing. And then there's the stick, the\nthing you're trying to avoid. I feel like it's-- the way\nit's landing for me is it's all stick and gas pedal. DAVID GOGGINS: That's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere's no carrot. You're not imagining, oh,\nwhen I'm a paramedic, when the book is published. And, obviously, you\nset those goals, and you make those targets. But it's all stick. DAVID GOGGINS: All stick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No carrot. DAVID GOGGINS: Think about that. I'm waking up\nright now studying. Like I have a test tomorrow. I already passed\nthe fucking test. Think about that. Every day in my life,\nthat's what I must do just to retain what I learned. Four hours plus a day, I\ngo through and do that. There's no stick. Or there's only a stick. There's never been\na carrot, which is why when I speak to\npeople, I have to figure out a way to resonate with them. Because all I want\nto say to them is let me teach you the\nreal life, how it really is. The reason why you're a loser\nand the reason why you're not fucking making it and\nthe reason why you're trying to go to all these-- I go to all these\nfucking conventions, speak all the fucking time. I look in the fucking audience. And these people\nsign up, sign up, sign up fucking every\nyear go to a convention, thinking they're going to learn\nsomething fucking different. No, you're lazy. You know exactly what to\ndo, exactly what to do. Because even me in my state\nof I can't read and write, I knew exactly what to do. It just sucks doing it. It sucks to do it. It sucks to wake up every\nmorning of your life and say, god, man,\nI'm not smart. So guess what I got to do. I got to study the same shit\nthat I got one of the highest scores in the nation on and\ndo it again, and do it again, and do it again. It's not just there. It's not just there\npermanently for me. So, yeah, it's all stick. It's all stick. The only carrot you have\nis like maybe, maybe. Because whenever I take these\ntests that are real hard, the back of my brain\nis like a good chance you're not going to\nmake it, Goggins. This ain't you, bro. This ain't you. You weren't born like this. This ain't you. The real you, bro-- study all you want to. But the second that\nfucking computer comes on with 150 questions,\nthis ain't you, man. And somehow, comes back. I passed. I passed again, passed again. But that real me back\nhere every fucking time is saying that ain't you, bro. That ain't you. And I have to\noutwork that voice. When I'm taking\nthat test and I get to a question I don't\nfucking know the answer, I'm like fuck, man. And then say, see\nI told you, man. That ain't you. You're 300 pounds, man. You sit at home. You figure out how\nto do your hair. That's what you do,\nhow to come to school with the reverse\nbaldness when you're 16. That's you. So there is no get\nout of jail free card. This is why I say stay hard. Because when you\nweren't given the gifts, the only thing you can\ndo in life is stay hard. And I know people\ncannot stand me. They can't stand this talk. This is all you can do. There's no magic pill\nor a magic potion. All you can do is\noutwork the man that God created\nor woman in you. And what that looks\nlike is unfun. That's why I said, do not\ndo a documentary on me because people will\nnot see the truth. They will see what\nthey want to see is I don't want to live like that. Good, good. And you will live\nexactly the way you live now,\nquestioning who you are, wondering what is\npossible, wondering what you are capable of doing. That's how that looks or you\ncan be me, which am I happy? I don't know. Never really thought about it. Don't really care about\nit because all I really cared about was when I looked\nin that fucking mirror, I saw a piece of shit. Happiness wasn't on the mirror\nat 16 or when I was 300 pounds. It wasn't like, I'm\nlooking for happiness. No, I'm looking at myself in\nthe mirror and say, all right, motherfucker, you\ndid it again today. You're a bad boy\nbecause that shit sucks. I have about a couple of minutes\nof that that I got the carrot. The second I lay down and\ngo to bed, the carrots gone because I'm waking up all\nthrough the night to check the work I did that day. Did I get this drug right? Did I get this right? Did I get that right? What did I do? Oh my god, fuck, I'm\nalready losing it. Stick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nstick's haunting you. DAVID GOGGINS: Haunting me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nfollowing you around. So no picture of\nJordan on the wall. You're not listening to\nYouTube inspiration video. DAVID GOGGINS: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those would\nbe all your voice anyway. [LAUGHTER] You're not listening to\nyour top 10 favorite songs just to get rolling and then\nlace the shoes, hit the books. It's all in here. DAVID GOGGINS: All in there. I used to do that\nwhen I was fat. Rocky, I mean,\nthat was my thing. Round 14 was my thing. And as I got older and older and\nolder, that started to go away. And I started to create-- I had all these people\nthat I used to watch. Rocky was one, Barnes,\nElias from \"Platoon,\" Jack from \"A Few Good Men\" when\nhe's on the stand going crazy. I saw a lot of these\ncharacters that I looked at and I was like, man, I\nain't got none of that. But they were characters. After a while, I lived\na life so disciplined that every body\nthat I once looked to, these fake characters,\nI built that as a man. And when I was younger, I\nhad this image in my mind of what does a man\nlook like to me? And I got all these people\nwho are badasses, characters. And in my mind, I became that. And that's what kept\nme going a lot was I had this pipe dream of\nbecoming a little bit of this and a little bit of\nthat because when you have no parents\nraising you and you have no role models growing\nup, it's not daydreaming. You start to create a reality\nlike, mm, maybe I can be that. And after becoming\nthis guy, that is the biggest thing I\ncan ever do in my life is I became that guy. That I once looked at\nall these, guys and now I look at myself like, god,\nwho the fuck can do that? I can. But what it takes\nis a discipline that no one can ever even-- they don't understand it. They don't understand it. But everybody has\nthe ability to do it, but they just don't want to. They want to keep\nasking questions and keep going to seminars. And the greatness\nis right in you. And that's why once again-- I say this a million times here,\nI do not feel sorry for you. I will not sugarcoat\nwhat I'm going to say to you because\nall of you know what I'm saying is the truth. Everybody knows it's the truth. This is what it looks like. And you know it too. You know it too. If you ain't got nothing, I hate\nto tell you what it looks like. It's ugly. It's not a documentary. It's not an HBO special. You ain't going to\nwatch me like, hey, man, you guys gotta watch this. No, it's like, oh, god, this\nlooks like a train wreck. It's like a nightmare. This looks like this guy's got--\nno, that's what it looks like. Hard work looks horrible. It's not motivating. It's not motivating at all. It ain't like Rocky round 14\nwhere he gets knocked down and goes like this\nto Apollo Creed. Looks like a man being\nstuck in a fucking dungeon. And there's no fucking way out. But you have the fucking key. But you refuse to use it. And that's nothing\nmotivating about that. So, yes, no documentary\non David Goggins. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The real life-- DAVID GOGGINS: The real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --David\nGoggins is the documentary. It's already being written. You're it. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm going\nto share a little neuroscience tidbit. DAVID GOGGINS: Love it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut I think it's one that you'll appreciate. Most people don't\nknow this, but there's a brain structure called the\nanterior mid-cingulate cortex. As we pointed out\nbefore, that's a noun. It's a name. It doesn't mean anything. We could call it\nthe Cookie Monster. But what's interesting\nabout this brain area is there are\nnow a lot of data in humans, not some mouse study,\nshowing that when people do something they don't\nwant to do like add three hours of exercise\nper day or per week or when people who are trying\nto diet and lose weight resist eating something,\nwhen people do anything that they, and this\nis the important part, that they don't want to do,\nit's not about adding more work. It's about adding more work\nthat you don't want to do. This brain area gets bigger. Now here's what's especially\ninteresting about this brain area to me. And by the way, I'm\nonly learning this recently because it's new data. But there's a lot of it. The anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex is smaller in obese people. It gets bigger when they diet. It's larger in athletes. It's especially\nlarge or grows larger in people that see\nthemselves as challenged and overcome some challenge. And in people that\nlive a very long time, this area keeps its size. In many ways,\nscientists are starting to think of the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex not just as one of the seats of\nwillpower but perhaps actually the seat of the will to live. DAVID GOGGINS: See,\nnow we're talking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd when I learned about the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex, I was like almost\nout of my seat. And I've been in the\nneuroscience game since I was 20. DAVID GOGGINS:\nNow we're talking. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe're the same age. And I was so pumped because I've\nheard of the amygdala, fear, prefrontal cortex. It's planning an action. I could tell you every\nbrain area and every-- I teach neuroanatomy\nto medical students. But when I started\nseeing the data on the anterior mid-cingulate\ncortex, I was like, whoa, this is interesting. And all the data\npoint to the fact that we can build this area up. But that as quickly\nas we build it up, if we don't continue to invest\nin things that are hard for us, that we don't want to\ndo-- that's the part that feels so Goggin-esque to me,\nthat we don't want to do. Like if you love the ice bath--\nyeah, I love the ice bath-- and you go from 1\nminute to 10 minutes, guess what, your anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex did not grow. DAVID GOGGINS: None. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But if\nyou hate the cold water, if you're afraid of drowning\nand you get into water and put your head\nunder and survive, then the anterior mid-cingulate\ncortex gets bigger. But if you don't do it the next\nday or if you do it the next day and you enjoy it because,\nhey, hey, I did it yesterday, woo-hoo, happy me, Merry\nChristmas as you would say-- DAVID GOGGINS: Right. Merry Christmas. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --guess\nwhat, the anterior mid-cingulate cortex\nshrinks again. To me, this is one of the\nmost important discoveries that neuroscience has\never made because it's that I don't want to do\nsomething but do it anyway that grows this area. And it's almost like-- I have a friend. He's been sober 30\nyears from alcohol. And he always says, the\namazing thing about addiction is there's a cure. The problem is it only\nworks one day at a time. And so you have to\nrenew it every day. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex to me-- when I learned about it, two\nthings went off in my head. Whoa, this is super interesting. And, two, I got to tell\nDavid Goggins about this. And I waited until now-- DAVID GOGGINS: I'm glad. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to tell\nyou because I felt like, well, for obvious reasons\nI wanted to tell you and I wanted to tell you here. DAVID GOGGINS: Well, I\nlove that because that's how I've lived my entire life. I don't know\nanything about that. But people go, man, you\nhave such a strong will. It's something that you build. Like I never forget I was\non a podcast one time. And this dude goes you were\nblessed with a strong mind. Like the hell are\nyou talking about I was blessed with a strong mind? That's something that\nyou have to develop. You develop that over\nyears, decades of suffering and going back into the suffer. That's why a lot of people who\ngraduate Navy SEAL training, they want to know-- I talk about it very\nopenly all the time. A lot of guys don't want\nto go back into that water, don't want to go back\ninto the hard stuff. And maybe not-- anything\nhard, anything hard in life, once you get through\nit, it's like you become a POW. Like how many POWs you know\nwant to go back to POW camp? None. When something sucks\nso bad in life-- this is on this that\nwe're talking about now-- very few people want to go back. They're happy they graduated. I realized I'm the same way. I don't want to go back. I have to go back. I must go back because that is\nexactly where all the knowledge of my life exists was back\nthere in what you're exactly what you're talking about. Well, I didn't know\nanything about this. But how I grew a will was\nconstantly doing these things to now it's just life. I wake up. While it still sucks,\nit's just life. You don't sit back\nand like, oh my god. Like I have days I\ndon't want to do. But I know I'm going to do it. I know from years\nof just doing it. So that's beautiful. And this is why I came\non here with you today. And I'm glad that you're talking\nabout this because human beings need to hear this. They need to stop hearing\nthese hacks on this and that. There's no fucking hack, bro. There's no fucking hack. Yeah, you may this and that\nand saunas and all this shit that they-- yeah, it's great. There is no fucking life hack. To grow that thing--\nhow do you grow it? Do it, and do it,\nand do it, and do it. That's the hack. The hack is going\nto fucking suck. And that's what I realized. That's what I realized. That's why I wanted\nto come on here today. I didn't want to\ncome on here and talk about no fucking\npassion and purpose and how to get the\nfuck out of bed and how to hit a\nfucking alarm clock, all this catchphrase bullshit\nbecause that wasn't how I lived, wasn't how I lived. I lived, I woke up like\nevery human being does and goes fuck, man. I'm a fucking piece\nof shit today. How the hell is this\ngoing to work out for me? And you fight that. And you fight that. You don't override it. There's no override button. It's the conversation\nin your head. So how do you do that? We don't have enough\nof these conversations about the real conversation that\nevery human being is having. And they have no idea\nhow to get out of it. But they do is that\nshit right there, man. You got to build your will. How you build your will? Exactly what you said, man. Exactly what you said. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nI feel like knowing the name of something,\nanterior mid-cingulate cortex, doesn't fundamentally change us. But one thing I\nlike about biology is that willpower, if somebody\nfeels they don't have it, feels like this thing\nthat other people have. But everybody, unless\nthey're brain-damaged, like a hole through their\nhead, has two anterior mid-cingulate cortex, one\non each side of their brain. Everyone has one. They have two. So I feel like it's just a\nquestion of opening the portal. And the portal-- again,\nI'm going to say 10 times, and forgive me--\nis I think people go, oh, I do hard things. I do sets to failure. And then I do forced reps. I love training with weights. I love doing sets to failure. I even like forced reps. But guess what? I like forced reps. So I'll tell you,\nthey don't build my anterior mid-cingulate\ncortex because I like to do it. Anything you like\nto do is not going to enhance this\naspect of willpower. And it seems so obvious\nonce you hear it. You kind of go, oh\nyeah, of course. But I think you really\nclose that loop for people when you share what\nyou're sharing today and what you've shared\nelsewhere before as well. When you're trying to\nexplain the friction is the critical ingredient. And I think people think,\noh, if it's effort, well, then I'm getting better. That's part of it, necessary,\nbut not sufficient, as we say in science. But the suck part, the haunt,\nbeing haunted, the stick, they're really unpleasant terms. These are probably the most\nunpleasant terms we've ever used on this podcast. Those are the--\nthose are the levers. Those are the gears. And without those, this thing\nthat you're talking about, David Goggins, as a verb-- I sometimes make the\njoke, but it's not a joke. Goggins is a name,\nand it's a verb. People go, I'm on\nto Goggins that. But that's, I think-- again, I'm not a psychologist. But I think that's what\nyou're talking about, the stick, the\nfriction, being haunted. It's the suck part that grows\nthis anterior mid-cingulate cortex. DAVID GOGGINS: So\nnow you know why there's so many people\nthat fail in this world to figure out their purpose,\ntheir purpose in life. Where do I go? Because to grow that, now,\nyou may not look like me, how my daily life looks. It don't look fun. Don't look fun. So it's a choice that\npeople have to make in life. But what's so funny about it\nis even the richest of rich, who have everything, they\nalways ask me this question. I feel like I'm\nmissing something. I don't feel like\nI'm missing shit. I don't have what you all have. But you will never in\nmy life hear me tell you I'm missing something. And everybody is. They're missing this feeling. I found it a long time ago. And I found it right there\nin that willpower thing. When you're nothing,\nnothing, and change yourself into something, like me, you\ncall it happiness, peace, whatever the fuck\nyou want to call it, people are missing exactly what\nwent on with David Goggins. Why don't you smile? I do. I do. But I figured something out. That's why I am never-- you never hear me say,\nI'm missing something. I found it years ago. You find it in the suck. You find it in the suck. And you find it repeatedly\nin the suck to the point where you know\nexactly who you are. Most people are\nmissing something because they don't\nknow who they are. They never examined themselves. They've never done this\nexperiment on themselves. The lab rat. We're all lab rats. But you're also the scientist. You create your own self. Most people are\nmissing something because there's so\nmuch trapped in there. I don't even want\nto say potential. I think that's a word--\nit's used out too much too. There's so much in you that\nGod or whoever the hell you believe in or if\nyou're an atheist in you that you have not unlocked,\nthat you walk around with this gorgeous wife or great\nhusband and all this money. You're like, god, I feel\nlike I'm missing something. Yeah, because it's\nabout 75% of you is still fucking in there, still\nchained up because you just didn't want to find\nyour willpower, didn't want to find your\nsoul, your will, your heart, your determination,\nyour guts, your courage. And what that looks\nlike, it looks scary, like you're little\nscary lab that went in. Scary to wake up every\nday and say, I'm stupid, but I'm going to\nfigure out a way to be smarter versus saying,\nman, I just can't do that. So you limit this box. So your box becomes so\nsmall of things you can do. My box wasn't even a box. It was a fucking little pinhole. And then through\nexamining myself, getting some willpower,\nsome courage, it became bigger\nthan this table. But that's what we all do. That's why I wanted to\ncome here today and talk to you about real shit,\nnot no fucking hacks. There's no hacks, bro. It's you against you. You against you. And if you\nmisunderstand that, you have a real problem,\nreal problem. I can understand\nyou misunderstand me, running down the street,\nshirt off, fuck this, no. Yeah. I can get it. I get it. If you misunderstand what\nI'm saying right now today, the problem is you. And you don't want to fix it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the\nchildren of wealthy people are a case study in how\nnot having enough friction can destroy a life. DAVID GOGGINS: True statement. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nmean, I could list off prominent names in the press. But those are actually\nthe least interesting. What's probably more\ninteresting, as an example, is all the ones we don't\nhear about because we never hear about them. They just dwindle and wither. Or I think there's this\nbig category of people, I'm realizing, as we have this\nconversation today that they're not super successful. They're not struggling. They're successful enough\nthat they never have to-- you can get to the\npoint where you don't have to impose friction. You even said it. Your bank account is in a\nplace where you don't really need to do all\nthe things you do, probably not even a\nsmall fraction of them. DAVID GOGGINS: Do nothing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. But you realize the\nstick and being haunted is the fuel and the engine. And you'd be a-- you'd be\ntruly crazy to give that up because you've\ninternalized all that. But most people, they're\ngood enough for them. And so they don't actually\nwant to be better badly enough in order to start\ngoing rung after rung. DAVID GOGGINS: Well, think\nabout when you build willpower. And think about how\nmuch I've built. Now that you know about this-- I didn't know about this. But think about how\nmuch I've built. Everything I've ever done in\nmy life, I didn't want to do. Everything every day. I'm a lazy piece of shit. And I'm one of the hardest\nworking people to ever step foot on this planet Earth. And I'm saying that very proudly\nbecause I know what I do. It's not cocky. I'll tell you I'm stupid. And I'll also tell you the exact\nopposite of what I've done. It's the truth. It is the truth. So imagine how much I've\ndeveloped in that time frame. But this is the scary thing. Why most people don't want to\ndo that and build that willpower is because it is scary. It unlocks a whole bunch\nof things about who you are and who you're not. And a lot of people don't\nwant to go down that journey to discover who they\nare and who they're not because it's not\na pretty journey. I mean, I've gone down it. It's not like I\nwent down it once. I go down it all the time. And when you unlock that-- and\nyou can't just turn it off. Like, people say, hey, how\ncome you haven't retired yet? I built all this willpower. Do you think it's\ngoing to let me just retire because my knees hurt? It is telling me every morning-- I wake up, and I'm like,\nman, my knees hurt. My legs hurt. My body hurts. But you can still run. So why aren't you running? If you can still run-- there will be a time when you\ncan't lace them up anymore. But you can still run. So I still run. When the time comes I can't\nrun, the body will say, you just can't run. But if I can still\ndo something, that willpower that I\nhave created, it makes me do it\nevery fucking day. And that's what they don't get. What builds a human being is you\nstart with the small building blocks. And before you know it,\nman, you become something that it doesn't even\nmake sense to most people because it's just\nwho you are now. That's why I can still\nrun at 50 with broke-- at 49 with broke down\nknees and broke down body because my body\nknows you still can. Therefore, I do. Second you stop, the\nwillpower is gone. And that's beautiful. I'm so glad you brought that to\nme because I always wondered, what's this\nseparation thing now? At 24 years old, I\nstarted building something that I didn't even\nknow was going to be what it is now at 49. And that's all it was. It was just that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This structure,\nanterior mid-cingulate cortex, has inputs and outputs\nfrom a bunch of places. But you'll probably not\nbe surprised to learn that it's strongly activated\nwhen we move our body when we don't want to move our body. I feel like it's like the\nDavid Goggins structure. DAVID GOGGINS: It really is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is. And it also has\nstrong connections to the dopamine reward pathway. And everyone goes,\nyay, dopamine. Everyone loves dopamine. I'm partially responsible\nfor people knowing a bit more about dopamine. But dopamine's badly understood. Everyone thinks\ndopamine, dopamine hits. It's about reward. It's about motivation and drive. And there are pain inputs to the\ndopamine centers of the brain. No one talks about that. Everyone's like, oh, you want\nthe chocolate, chocolate, sex, cocaine. Yeah, that's all true. It'll release dopamine. Pain releases dopamine. The anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex can trigger the release\nof dopamine in response to this thing that\nwe're calling friction. And that's a learned thing. That's something that\nno animal or human being comes into the world learning. We all are averse to pain. And like pleasure,\nlike sugar, fat. Don't like hot surfaces. But this is a\nstructure that learns. It has neuroplasticity,\nthe ability to change throughout\nthe entire life span. And here's the\npart that I think, again, is just neuro nerd\nspeak for what you already know and have done and exemplify,\nis that people say, oh, it has plasticity. You can change it. But guess what? It has plasticity\nin both directions. It can grow. But just as easily as it can\ngrow, it's like Silly Putty, it can shrink. So it requires constant upkeep. And that answer isn't one\nthat people are going to like. They're like, give\nme the energy drink. Give me the supplement. Give me the-- give me\nthe sauna protocol that's going to make my anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex-- there's someone out there\nright now who's going, wait, if I took transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation and I stimulate-- yeah, you'd\nprobably-- actually, they've done that. They stuck a little\nwire during neurosurgery into this structure. This was actually\ndiscovered by a colleague of mine, Joe Parvizi. Stimulate. And the patients go, I feel\nlike there's a storm coming. And they go, oh, is it scary? And they go, no, I\nwant to go through it. They come off the stimulation,\nand people are like-- this is the seat of what\nwe're talking about. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. Exactly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it learns. So the fact that you've\nkept this brain structure-- I'm convinced if we imaged\nyour brain, it'd be large, and it would be larger\nin two years, in a year. But this is the no days off\nrationale because it can grow, and it can shrink. DAVID GOGGINS: I know. What you're saying right now,\nI didn't know any of this. And I never-- and I\nalways talk to you. But I wish I could\njust put this on paper. And you're saying it in a way\nthat people can understand. I can never put it into\nwords on what I built and the power that\nis within all of us. But you put it so\nin a scientific way. Most people, for\nme, he's just crazy. That's why I don't like\ntalking about it, man. I know I'm not crazy. I know what I had to do\nto get where I had to go. People look at it as crazy\nbecause there are people that just-- if you can't imagine\nyourself doing something, if you can't imagine\nyourself doing something, the person that's\ndoing it is crazy because in your mind, the logic\nbehind it, it doesn't compute. Therefore, you have to\ngive somebody a title. And the title for me\nis usually he's crazy or he's this, he's that. No. No. For some reason, me\nwanting to be somebody so fucking bad in my\nlife, I created that. And I've been\ntrying to figure out years of my life trying\nto explain to people. But even though you're\nexplaining it now, this is the easy fucking part. Them listening to this shit\nis the easy fucking part. The part that why they're\nalways be the ones of ones is because putting\nthat practice, putting that into\nactual work, no, man. No. No. That's where the demons come in. That's where you're like,\nI don't want to be better. I don't want to be better. If this is what it\ntakes to be better, I don't want to be better. So everybody's-- that's why\nthere's a lot of average. And it makes me so fucking mad. Every day I walk this\nEarth, and I see average all over the fucking place. And they want to ask\nme, how did you do it? I can't tell you how because\nyou're not going to fucking-- you're not going to do it. You're not going to do it you. You're just going to-- You're going to continue\nbeing like this every day you wake up. Like you said, it's\nlike, get the coffee. Make the pancakes. Kiss the girl. Kiss the kids. You wake up, right to work. Immediate, your\nmind is in action. No one wants to do that. No one. And I don't blame them. But don't be mad when\nyou're laying there in your fucking bed, and\nyou're in the fucking hospital, and you're 70, 80, 90 years old. And you're thinking,\nman, I feel like I didn't fucking do something. Because you did. You didn't do it. You didn't do shit. You may have lived\na great life, man, but you're always going\nto feel empty inside. I don't feel empty. So call me what you want. There's not one empty\nbone in my fucking body because I have figured\nout that really-- the magic potion,\nat least to my life. And it's very rewarding. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a quick break and thank our sponsor,\nInsideTracker. InsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help me better\nunderstand your body and help you reach\nyour health goals. I've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done for the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact your immediate and\nlong-term health can only be analyzed from\na quality blood test. Now, a major problem\nwith a lot of blood tests out there, however,\nis that you get information back about metabolic\nfactors, lipids, and hormones and so forth. But you don't know what to\ndo with that information With InsideTracker,\nthey make it very easy, because they have a\npersonalized platform, that allows you to see\nthe levels of all those things, metabolic factors,\nlipids, hormones, et cetera. But it gives you\nspecific directives that you can follow that\nrelate to nutrition, behavioral modification,\nsupplements, et cetera that\ncan help you bring those numbers into the ranges\nthat are optimal for you. If you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker, you can go to\ninsidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans. Again, that's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman. People like to talk about what\nthey used to be able to do. I hear this a lot. You should have seen\nme in high school. I always laugh. Like, yeah, OK. Got it. And it's not just guys. You should have seen me\nworking out in high school. I was super fit. People will look\nback to a time where they felt like they were\ncapable of something. And now they're not. And you kind of want to\njust grab them and go, wait. That was you then. It's you now. And but people tend\nto think about how the conditions that\nwere around success must have been part of it. And you can understand why. It's very rational. I was in that situation. I was successful. I'm in this situation. I'm not. That was the past. This is the present. Ergo, capable. You see how people\nget into these loops. And as you mentioned, you spent\nthe first 20 years of your life in extremely challenged\ncircumstances. And then you can see how\npeople get to a point where everything feels hard. Like, when you're 300 pounds-- I haven't ever been 300 pounds. But I can't imagine it feels\ngood to get up and move around. DAVID GOGGINS: It's defeating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got a friend. He's in excess of 300 pounds. We've been trying\non him for years. But no win. And he's got crazy psoriasis\non the back of his calves. And he actually\nsmells bad sometimes because he can't wash\nas well as he would. He's big, big. And it pulls all my sympathy. But life is very hard for\nhim and getting worse. He's a young guy with\na lot of medical issues now, for obvious reasons. And so I think people like that\nthink, well, it's already hard. Why would I make it harder? Your message is a\nlittle different. And you have the\nlife experience. DAVID GOGGINS: It's\na lot different. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou've been there. So for me, saying, oh\nyeah, lose weight-- I was a skinny guy who got\nto be a less skinny guy. So I don't really have\na foot to stand on. What do you say to those\npeople who are like, listen, getting up in\nthe morning is hard. Trying to not dissolve into\na puddle of my own tears and my own misery is hard. DAVID GOGGINS: You know why\npeople connect with my books so well? For some reason, God put me\nin almost every fucked up situation on the planet Earth. So when I talk to people,\nit's not sugar-coated because I'm not saying it from I\nwas a 175 pounds my whole life. I don't say much\nto those people. Maybe you're a piece of shit. Maybe you want to be nobody. Maybe you're happy exactly\nwhere you are in life because obviously, you are. Maybe you don't have\nthe determination to be somebody better\nthan who you are. And if you want to live with\nthat, I'll support you in that. If you're good with being who\nyou are, that every day you wake up, and every day, you\nsmell like shit because you can't wash your body well,\nand your skin is messed up because your health's\nso bad, and you can't put your clothes on\nright, you need help with that. You need help like--\nwhen I was 300 pounds, I needed help wiping my ass. That makes you feel good? Nothing I can say to you. If every day you wake up with\nthis-- see, people are haunted. But they obviously\nlike horror films because they keep watching\nthe same fucking movie. I don't like horror films. A lot of people\nlike horror films. So I don't say much to them. I say exactly what I\nsaid to you right there because I was once you. I didn't like horror\nfilms, so I changed it. Some people are just-- they become-- like you\nsaid, it gets real small when you're lazy and\nyou're fat, your will. Their will is so small\nthat they don't have any. And you can't give it to them. There has to be\nsomething-- this is what I'm talking about now\nbecause this isn't a hack. This has to be in you. Something in you has to wake up. And usually, the only person\nthat can wake it up is you. Sometimes you can read\na David Goggins book because I was all this shit and\nthen a lot more of fucked up. But if you don't have a\nlittle flame, just barely-- you're done. I can't light it for you. And that's the harsh\nreality of this life that I want to get\nacross so fucking bad. You can watch me. You can watch you. You can watch fucking\nRogan and Cameron Hanes, all these motherfuckers. You can go to Tony\nRobbins's fucking bullshit, all this shit. You can do all this shit. You're going to keep\ngoing back and keep spending money and\nspending money and spending money with no results. You're going to wonder, wow. Maybe let me go try\nout David Goggins. He ain't going to\nfucking help you. You have to explore, examine\nthe insides of yourself. And what do you really\nwant out of life? Your friend and a lot\nof people out here just don't fucking want it. So guess what? Have fun with your life. Go from 300 to 350\nto 400 to 450 to 500 because you don't want it. And that's the harsh reality. I can't give you shit. You can't give them shit. We can give you ideas. But end of the day, when\nI was losing the weight, I had to miserably wake up\nevery morning in the cold because it was Indiana,\nNovember, when it started. I was miserable. This is your new life. Take it or leave it. There's no happiness about it. There's no peace behind it. It sucks. It just fucking sucks. And that's the one thing, if I\ncould teach anybody anything, it just fucking sucks. And it's going to\ncontinue to suck. And then one day, you'll get\nto a special part in your life that it might get a\nlittle bit better. But to lose the weight you\nhave to lose, my friend, sorry. It's going to suck every\nfucking day because then when you're 300 pounds, you're\ngoing to go out to lose weight, you could probably get injured. So then you got to\nwork on the injury. And then you get\neven more depressed. This is what I went through. And then you're hungry\nbecause now you're depressed. It's just a vicious cycle. And if you're not\nstrong mentally and you have no\nwillpower, you're going to continue\nfalling back in this hole versus the man that\nsits back and goes, all right, motherfucker. This is why I cuss because\nthis is what is in me. This is what it took\nfor me to be me. Sorry. It didn't take, hey, OK,\nwe're going to do this today. No. This fucking really sucks. This is real, dude. This is real. And every day, I'm set back. I'm set back. I'm set back. I'm set back. So this is what I\nwould tell your boy. This is exactly\nwhat I'd tell him. Every day you wake up,\nyou're going to probably be set back for the\nfirst four weeks before you lose significant\nweight because the mind is going to be fucking\nwith you the whole time. There's no dopamine. There's no dopamine in\nthere at 300 pounds. You got nothing. Your hormones are shot. You have to envision something\nthat is more powerful than you. Something has to\nget you out of bed. And you have to create it. It has to be false\nbecause you're not it. You're a fat piece of shit. And that's the reality of it. So you have to create a false\nreality, to live in that just to get to work on yourself. That's the reality. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He'll\nsee this, and he'll appreciate that message. We'll see what he does. DAVID GOGGINS: We'll see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So far, last\n13 years, it's been no movement. But I have had other\nfriends who were drug and alcohol addicts who\nquit after one conversation. Never went back. DAVID GOGGINS: That's awesome. That means they want it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, just\none guy, I won't out him, but walked up to me at a\nparty in 2019, July 4th party, and said, I'm a pile. And I go, what? And he goes, I'm a pile. Look at me. I'm 60 pounds overweight. And I go, do you drink? He goes, every day. I go, how much? He goes, a case. He goes, I smoke a lot of weed. But he's successful in\nother areas of his life. And so I said, well,\nhere's what I know. Quit alcohol and weed for you. I'm not telling\npeople what to do. Don't eat until 2:00 PM. Get on an exercise\nbike, and pedal in the morning like someone's\nchasing you with a poison dart until you want to puke. And I was kind of half-joking. And then two months\nlater, he was, like, I haven't had a drink. I lost 30 pounds. He lost those 60 pounds. He never went back. Now, he's super fit. It's amazing. So some people flip the switch. He is very\nself-critical by nature. DAVID GOGGINS:\nThat's what flips-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's\nsuper self-critical. DAVID GOGGINS: Yep. That's what flips the switch. Think about it, man. We know what to do. We don't need Andrew Huberman\nto tell us what to do. We know what to do,\nevery one of us. That's why he flipped it so\nfast because he knew what to do. He didn't go by\nyour exact protocol. He didn't go by the exact-- no. He knew exactly what to do. And you just saying some shit\nto him, it woke something up. He knew what to do. And that's the thing that\npeople need to get that. You know what to do. Why aren't you doing it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'm\ntalking about myself now. Those modes of just kind\nof passive consumption, they're so easy to wash over us. I used to have this thing,\nand I'm fighting this now because I knew we were\ngoing to have this conversation today, where I like\nto start things on the hour or the half hour. Worst practice in\nthe world for me because if I miss that half\nhour, I'm like, oh, it's 12:33. I'll start at 12:45. Ah, it's 12:45. I'll start at 1:00. I just lost time. And so this is so stupid. And the other day,\nI was like, man, I got to tell David about this\nbecause my new thing is I start no matter what time it is. If I wake up in the\nmiddle of the night-- I got a friend. He paints in the\nmiddle of the night. I'm like, you're an insomniac? He's like, I don't know. I just do it. Then sometimes he\ngoes back to sleep. Sometimes he doesn't. Everyone's got their thing. But I thought about this. I'm like, no more am I\ngoing to say I'm starting at 1:00 because I know me. If I miss the 1:00 ding and then\nmy pen's not hitting the paper or I'm not typing\non the keyboard, I'm not going to do it. But That's a\nself-admitted weakness. DAVID GOGGINS: I love it, man. I had that for a lot of years. I know I'm going to do it. That's the haunting part is\nthat it's going to happen. It has to happen. And that's a fact. Like, there's no get out\nof jail free card, bro. None. Like, that is a life\nthat I don't know. I don't have that ability. Or I have the ability. I don't have the-- I'm not good enough,\nsmart enough. I'm not talented\nenough to do that. Some people are. Some people can start at 1:00. Some people don't\nhave to start at all. If you lack talent, you\ncan't sit back and say, I'll start in half an hour. I can't do that. I got to start now. And after I get back from\nstarting, I got to start again. And then when I get done with\nthat run or that study session, if it wasn't good enough,\nI got to go back again because repetition is\nwhat taught me everything. So you can honestly\noutwork anything. But it's that you, obviously,\nare a very talented man. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I have\nworked hard at certain things and built up some\nthings that I've been good at most of my life. DAVID GOGGINS: You're amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Gathering,\norganizing, and disseminating information's\nsomething I've been doing since I was a little kid. I used to give lectures at\nschool on Monday about stuff I learned over the weekend. DAVID GOGGINS: See,\ncheck that out. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But they\ntook me to a psychiatrist. We're the same age. Back then, if you got\nsent to a psychiatrist, people thought you were crazy. DAVID GOGGINS: I was one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, exactly. DAVID GOGGINS: I was one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. So I remember\nfeeling like a freak. Also, I didn't have a stutter,\nbut I had a grunting tic. It comes back when I'm tired. And the only thing that\nhelped that was hitting my head on something,\nshaking my head, which is why skateboarding\nwas good because I'd slam, and I'd feel like, oh. I feel good. But that's not healthy. That's not good. Or just work. Work is what gets it out. It's like an-- it's\nlike an RPM or high. [REVVING SOUND]\nAnyway, that's me. But yeah, I think\ncertain things over time, I feel like talent or gifts or\nwhatever you want to call them, but there are many\nthings that are exceedingly difficult for me. And I have learned\nfrom your example. I know that you are very\nboth humble and very clear that you don't have--\nyou say, you're not going to get it\nby examining you. But I think the way\nyou're sharing today and the way you've shared\nit on other podcasts before, there are pieces\nthat really help people feel into\nthe process of what you're talking about today. We're elaborating on it, I\nthink, a lot, this notion of being haunted and the stick. I mean, of course, of course,\nnow it makes so much sense why you don't want to talk about\nsleep or rest or recovery because that's-- sure, that's important. I've heard you say,\nyes, you sleep. Yes, you eat. Yes, you hydrate. Yes, you will stretch\nyour psoas or whatever. But it's funny how that\nbecomes the viral message. DAVID GOGGINS: That's why\nI said fuck that today. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nthat's not the unique-- that's not the unique\nmessage that you carry. Like, anyone can\ntalk about that. So do I have that right? That you're acknowledging\nsleep is important. Recovery is important. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that's\nnot what you're about. DAVID GOGGINS: You have\nto forego something. Yes. Ice baths. Saunas. Sleep. Nutrition. All this shit's so\nfucking important, dude. I don't have time\nfor some of it. To extract what I had to\nextract, something had to give. Like, you talk about you\nwhen you were younger. You would give these\nspeeches and stuff. The same age you\nwere giving speeches, I was trying to figure out how\nto say the without stuttering. And I realized, as I got older,\nthat all these things are important. But for me to stop\nstuttering, I got to build fucking confidence. And speech therapy\ndidn't help that. Nothing helped that. I have to forgo a lot of\nshit to be as fucked up as I am to build\nconfidence, for me to stand in a fucking room of\n10,000-- of one person, and not [STUTTERING SOUNDS] and be\nlike, oh, and put my head down. Let me look around. Let me read these\nparagraphs first. And then before I\nread the paragraphs, because they're\ncalling me next, let me just leave the room\nbecause I'm going to stutter. That's a miserable life. And that's one of many\nthings I did besides lying, besides being insecure,\nbesides being immature, besides being fat, besides\nbeing one of the only Black kids in my school. There's a lot of things I had\nto overcome to gain confidence. And in doing so, a\nlot of that had to go. A lot of it. So I became the guy that became,\nonce again, misunderstood. You only sleep four hours\na day, two hours a day? Sometimes you\ndon't sleep at all? Like, what's this, and\nwhat's this, and what's this? I know it's all important. I can't. Something's got to go. For me to get confidence,\nbecause confidence is the building block of\nwhere I'm trying to go, for me to gain\nconfidence in myself, this fucked up kid has got\nto do a lot of fucked up shit to gain confidence. And along the way,\nthe stutter went away. And I gained confidence. And now, my life is\na little bit more-- there is no balance. There is no balance. It's a little bit more what it\nshould be for a lot of people. But there'll never be balance\nbecause confidence is something that you're constantly-- confidence and belief\nyou're building every day. And so something's got to give. And I'm willing to\nforego a lot of things to have that because\nI know if you want to give\nsomebody kryptonite, take that shit away from them. So yeah, I don't\nsleep sometimes. And sometimes I don't\neat the right way. And sometimes I don't do this\nand do that and whatever, man. But you put me in a room\nof 10,000 people any time of the day, and I'll\nwalk in there thinking I'm the baddest\nmotherfucker in here because I know what it\ntook to be on this stage. And a lot of people\nwould not do that. So that's what it takes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere's a question I've been wanting to ask\nyou since we started. And I thought about\ncoming in here. And I've been thinking about\nin the weeks ahead of this. And I'm going to just come\nclean and say I don't exactly know how to ask the question. DAVID GOGGINS: Just ask it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nabout relationships. DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, do it, man. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo I know in myself that my discipline is much\nhigher when it's just me. But that's because I had\ncertain things early on. But then I was a\nterrible student. Barely finished high school. But then when I got\nserious, I got serious. But I did that by staying\naway from everybody. And anyone's who's ever had\na relationship of any kind, but in particular,\nromantic relationships, knows that, yes, you can derive\ntremendous support from those. Like, you got this, baby. You can go. And you're like, yeah. I got this. She said I got this. Feels great to finish something\nand share with someone, share a meal, get the hug. But there's another\nside to all of that that I'd like to learn\nmore about from you, which is there's a\nwarm body next to you in bed in the morning. You don't want to get up. They also have needs. You've got your mission\nthat people sometimes need things from us. But also, oftentimes,\nthe people that love us most, that truly love\nus and that want to support us, don't understand this thing. And they're the first people\nto tell us, like, listen. Take a day off. And then this whole cycle,\nat least in my head, goes off, like, you\njust want a vacation. And then it's almost\nlike a paranoia. I'm not saying anything\nnice about myself right now. DAVID GOGGINS: All good, man. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nFormer girlfriends are going to be like, yeah. Like, they remember that. And so support of people\nclose to you is critical. This could be friends. Could be romantic partners. Whatever. But they're also-- the\nknife cuts both ways. It can be the thing\nthat can really undermine this thing that you're\ntalking about because people that care about us also\nwant to see us comfortable. They want to see us happy. They want to see us peaceful. They want to see us wake up\nfrom a great night's sleep. And they want things too. So how do you untangle\nthat whole bit? DAVID GOGGINS: Well,\nit's funny, man. I'm unbalanced, but\nI'm mostly unbalanced towards the family side, which\npeople don't get about me. I'll start being unbalanced. I get all my stuff in. But what I do is I make sure\nthat my family has everything they need, everything\nthey need, those who want to be part of my family. Some don't. Some family members don't want\nto be part of David Goggins. I get it. I got it. That's life. Those who are part\nof my family, I give them everything\nthey need so they can leave me the fuck alone. I make sure you're happy as fuck\nbecause I got to go to work. And I don't mean smokejumping. I don't mean running. I mean all of it. It takes every-- I can't have you\nin my fucking shit. I can't. So I know for me\nto have a family, I gotta make sure that you\nrealize I'm going to give you everything you need. So when you start\nbitching at me, I'm going to say, look, hang on. I dedicated my life to give\nyou everything you need. I need this time\nright here for me to be the best I can be\nbecause this journey started without anybody. And I make sure everybody knows\nthat who comes in my life. I've been left-- think about it. I was left alone at a young\nage to figure this shit out. I figured it out for myself\nand have been very successful for myself. No one's going to come in\nhere and fuck with my shit. That's why I make sure I will\ntake care of whatever you need. Whatever you need\nfrom me, you got it. Money, house, my\nlove, my support, I'm going to give you\neverything you need. That said, I do it the\nhighest level possible. And I'm saying that with\nJennifer in the next room. So please come here\nand say something if it's wrong, Jennifer. I don't give a fuck. Say what you got to say. So then when it's time\nfor me to go to work, I expect you to\ndo the same for me because it takes every bit of\nme to do what I have to do. So I make sure that I'm very\nunbalanced from my family so I can be exactly that\nunbalanced for myself. And that's how I do it. I let people know\nright up front, I'm not what you want in a man. I guarantee that. There's going to be\na lot of late nights, a lot of early\nmornings, a lot of times where I got to be by myself\nthinking about the process that is next in my mind. I can't have aggravation. I can't have this. Can't have that. There's a lot of things. But I let them know up front. I'm very vocal about that. Sometimes relationships\nwork for me. Sometimes they didn't. But that's who I am. One thing I did wrong in my life\nwas I tried for so many years to please people. And I did it at the\nexpense of myself. I was leaving a lot in the tank. And when you do that,\nyou stop living. But the person in your\nlife is happy as fuck because you're giving\nthem everything they want. They have their--\ntheir life is full. But you feel empty. And that's not a\nrelationship to me. So for me, it's\nimportant that you know exactly who I am because\nthis is what life made. And I'm not trying to change it\nbecause I just figured it out. So I'm not trying to\ncompromise David Goggins. I would never, ever\ncompromise David Goggins. That doesn't mean I won't\ngive you what you need and what you want\nand what you desire. But I don't need money. I don't need fame. I don't need shit. So I give it all away. What I do need is to make sure\nthat that willpower is worked on every fucking day and every\nnight for the rest of my life because that's the\none thing that's going to keep me feeding you,\nkeeping you where you need to be, because once\nthat willpower is gone, 300-pound David Goggins,\nhe may not look like it, but I will walk around with it. So the things that are\nimportant to you in life, you must do always. Or you're nobody. And that's how I\nhandle relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amen to that. Something I could\npersonally work on is that upfront,\nclear communication because it resonates that\nfeeling of there's something inside that's not getting worked\nout that, when I'm on my own, it's a lot easier. But then, of course, wanting\nrelationships and family, I think that's a healthy\npart of being human too. And obviously,\nyou've worked it out. So I appreciate\nyou sharing that. I don't think I've\never heard you talk about it that way before. DAVID GOGGINS: People are\nscared of that conversation with their wife, husband,\ngirlfriend, boyfriend. But why are you scared of it? Why are you scared to tell\na motherfucker, your wife, your husband, who you are, who\nyou are, exactly who you are? And that was the problem\nI had-- that's a problem that a lot of us have in life. No one knows who you really are. No one knew who I really was. I went to a school where there\nwere a lot of Black kids. A lot of Black kids didn't\nwant to be in special ops. I never talked about\nspecial ops to Black kids. Why? I was wondering what-- I'm not going to fit in. That's not what they do. A lot of Black kids don't\ndo that kind of shit. So whatever I wanted\nto do, no one really knew the real me growing up\nbecause I never wanted anybody to know the real me. I was always afraid\nof what you might say or how you're going\nto feel or whatever. You got feelings. You have a life that\nyou have to live. So it's important that\nwhatever's on your mind, you let that person know. Therefore, you're\ngiving them the option to be with you or not. This is who I am. If you don't like\nit, that's good, man. I got it. But this is David Goggins. So that honest conversation\nis very important, man, so everybody knows\nwhere they stand. That person may not be for you. And that's all good. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThis world could use a lot more of that upfront,\ncompletely honest conversation. I feel like so much of\nthe world's problems are because everyone's\ndancing around these issues. DAVID GOGGINS: It takes a lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRecently in the news, seeing people losing\ntheir job because they won't say something publicly. You can tell they\nkind of what it. It's like, people just,\nI think, deep down really crave the direct message. Like, what are you about? What are you not about? But I think now, everyone's\nafraid of getting canceled. It's a big deal, getting\ncanceled, that people think, oh, I can't work\nif I am who I am. Or if I'm not pretending\nto be somebody else, then silence is\nconsidered agreement. There's all sorts of\ncomplicated stuff. And I do feel for the\ngeneration coming up because we didn't have\nsocial media and all of that. Again, just walled\noff from that. There's a real benefit from\njust not paying attention. DAVID GOGGINS:\nPeople love to lie. People love to lie. You know, I thought\nI was only a person-- when I was growing\nup, I thought I was the only person that lied\nbecause I lived in a bubble. And people love to lie\nabout who they're not. They love to lie about\nwho they're not, dude. And that's, for me, the\nreason why I'm so vulnerable, and I'm so real and honest. Find somebody to\ncome out and tell me I'm lying about my fucking life. And for me to come\nwhere I came from and have the resume\nI have now, you know the confidence you get? How I don't care who--\nyou're going to-- you're going to judge me? You're going to judge me? What have you done in your life? So me, being so honest and\nso upfront and so truthful, that came with me finally\nfiguring out who I was, but also conquering David\nGoggins, the demons of David Goggins. Therefore, now, you're\njust an open book. You look at somebody, look\nthem right in the eye. Tell me exactly who\nthe fuck you are. You walk away. I'm good, bro, because I know\nexactly what this journey took to get here. And that gives you a fire\nand a passion that people can call you nigger,\nthey can call you-- if you're a lesbian or\ngay or bise-- call me whatever the fuck you want. If you put yourself in\nthe fire and you come out every fucking day like this,\nbrush it off, not scared to go back in there\nagain, come on, man. Your truth is real. You come out every\nday, man, with a way of talking to people that people\ndon't have because there's no truth behind them. And the truth is\nthe starting line. When you sit down the ugly\nmirror and say, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this and this,\nyou finally started your life. Maybe 40 years old. Maybe 40 years old,\nfive, six kids, wife. But the second you look in that\nmirror and you say, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm this,\nI'm this, well, basically, I'm not this, I'm not this,\nI'm not this, I can't do this, I can't do this, I'm\nall these insecurities, your life finally started. And once you start that\nlife, man, the truth comes out big time because\nyou no longer care. So that's the problem. Most people just don't want\nto have that conversation to the point where they can go\non stage and a million people and say, I'm all of this. And have a good day. See you. It's empowering. It's very empowering. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I feel like the\nway we're educated in school, but also outside of school, is\nwe're trained, as human being, as these young brains,\nto try and figure out how to get positive\nfeedback from other people. It's like we're little dogs. You have a bulldog. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI had a bulldog. Saw the picture of your bulldog. She's great. DAVID GOGGINS: Charlie dog. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They're\nan amazing species. DAVID GOGGINS: They are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nof them economy of effort or amazing breed, excuse me. They're an amazing breed. Economy of effort. They don't do anything\nunless it's necessary. It's the exact opposite of\neverything we're talking about. It's kind of interesting. And they're kind of hedonists. Now, it is true that\nthey'll die to protect you. DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nit's an instinct. I saw that with Costello. I'm sure that-- DAVID GOGGINS: I\nsaw it with Charlie. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's an instinct. But if they're not\nin that position, if there's no need\nto exert effort-- DAVID GOGGINS: They're resting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. So your bulldog's\nresting for you. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. Got it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. So you don't need\nto rest because-- DAVID GOGGINS: Active\nrecovery Charlie. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect. DAVID GOGGINS: That's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perfect. That's going to be your\nanswer from now on. People go, does he sleep? Does he rest? Go, no. He somehow worked it out so\nhis bulldog does it for him. DAVID GOGGINS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut we're sort of indoctrinated into\nthis way of being from a time that we're\nyoung, where, of course, praise feels good. Someone tells you, hey, I like\nthat shirt, or good job today, or nicely done. Or for me, because growing up\nin a big pack of friends growing up, and I was never the greatest\nathlete, wasn't terrible, wasn't great, et cetera, like,\na fist bump, or, like, feeling crewed up. And you're just like, yeah. But you've talked about\nthis before in reference to the SEAL Teams. We both know a lot of\npeople in that community. And the Teams component is a big\npart of it for a lot of people. And it's a wonderful thing. But there's a danger\nto that dopamine hit, for lack of a better\nway to put it, from we can only derive when\nit's coming from the outside. You're talking about being\nable to either say, good job, but also, just look to one's\nown personal history and say, I've done hard things. And I can do it again and again\nbecause I do it again and again and again. You're talking about parenting\nyourself, inspiring yourself, scaring yourself, all\nof that from the inside. So very different\nthan the way we're raised, which is to figure\nout how to get the biscuit. DAVID GOGGINS: It's funny, man. People want to know how\nI'm always motivated. It's the unseen work, which you\njust said is a true statement. Those are false dopamine\nhits that people are giving you, man. There's no belief in that. These are teamwork\ndopamine-- like, I'm out running at 2 o'clock\nin the morning, 1 o'clock in the morning in the\ngym, long sessions by myself. That's real. I'm able to extract dopamine,\nthe good dopamine whenever I want. Man, I've trained\n99% of my life alone. No one patted me on the back. I did all of the work alone. And while I'm still hard on\nmyself, I know what I did. So whenever times\nget bad for me, people are all this, who's going\nto carry the boats and lo-- that's real. I hate that people\nknow me for that guy because that guy is\nnot every fucking day. When they see me,\nthey want that energy. That's not me every day. I can extract it\nimmediately when I need to because when you train alone-- and I lived alone for so\nmany years in this misery. And you're able to\nget out by yourself. I can take myself to such\na level of real passion and purpose. And the feeling I\nget is something I can't even explain by mys-- I don't need anyone. That's why people come\nto me to motivate them. No one can motivate me. I have a resume full\nof fucking motivation that whenever I'm down, I'm\nlike, oh hang on, motherfucker. Oh, you know the truth. You know the truth. You know the darkness\nof the fucking dungeons and the fucking demons that fly. And then from there,\nit's like, OK. You were there. You know this. There was no one\nthere to pick up the rucksack, to pick\nup the boat, to pick up the log, to go in there. It was you. It was you. There was no pat on the fucking\nback at 300, at 275, at 250, at 220. No. That was you. So those things\nthat come out of me, that extract from me\nin the darkness, people are looking for that\npat on the back. Where is it? Oh, I don't need it\nbecause what I've done is in the fucking unseen work. I built Frankenstein. So whenever shit gets\nnasty, David Goggins goes, you had nobody\nanyway, motherfucker. So see how I'm talking\nto myself right now? That's me. That's shit fires\nme the fuck up. That shit makes me fucking nuts. You had nobody\nanyway, motherfucker. Look around you. There was no fucking team. It was you. There was no weight loss program\nor mom and dad waking you up, saying you can do it, you can be\nbetter, trying to build belief. You built belief\nwhen you had nothing. Rock bottom. You did that. So as times get hard for\nme, the truth comes out. And my truth is\npowerful as fuck. It's real. It's tangible. I feel it. It comes out of my brain\nas I speak about it. I'm reliving every single dark\nmoment of my life to be here. So that is what\npeople don't get. That is what motivates David\nGoggins is the unseen work. But everybody needs\nthat pat on the back. They need that training partner. They need that\naccountability coach. I don't need that shit. And neither do they. But it's what we've\ntrained ourselves to believe that we need. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nalmost like there's this pill on the shelf. I'm speaking in analogy. And we take it, and\nwe get jazzed up. And we're like, yeah. But there's this other\nmedicine cabinet behind there. And it's in us. You're saying the real\nmedicine cabinet is inside. DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yes. When you continue to overcome-- and I had so many\nobstacles to overcome. So it's actually\na benefit to me. But the benefit, it's not\nlike a benefit like that. You have to have the\ncourage and the patience to overcome and overcome. Before you know it, man, you\nhave a whole medicine cabinet. But there's no medicine\nin the motherfucker. There's no pre-workout. I don't take none of that shit. All I got to do\nis flip my brain. Put my finger in there and\nsay, OK, that's a good one. It's all I got to do, man. I got the Rolodex. I'm just like, go fuck\nyourself, Goggins. And oh, but you won. Let's do that one today. There's nothing I need. And this is the\nthing that people don't get about David Goggins. I can't teach it in\na 1-minute video. We all have this ability to\nhave our own medicine cabinet. But unless you go in there\nand put the medicine in there, it's always going to\nbe fucking empty, man. You're always going to\nneed the pre-workout. You're always\ngoing to need the-- I don't drink coffee. I don't do ca-- I don't do none of that. I don't need it. I can run for 70 hours, and\nI have before, no caffeine. I got all this wonderful shit\nthat I overcame on my own, by myself, in the darkness,\nthat, man, when it's cold, I'm hot. When it's hot-- I can feed myself all the time. That's why when people\nsay, man, why aren't you missing anything, I can't\nexplain it to you, man. Can't explain it to you. You'll never understand. That's why I don't do\nall these podcasts, dude. I love you, man. That's why you-- my first\nbook, you did a blurb for me. That's why I'm here. I love what you're\ndoing for people, man. But I can't explain this. I can't. I can't explain this because\npeople don't want to do this. They don't want to do this, man. But I don't know, man. I get jazzed up even\ntalking about it, man, because so many people\nthink my life is just so, oh god, his life is horrible. Don't follow him. He's crazy. Really? ANDREW HUBERMAN: But there\nare a good number of people, I would say, and that's an\nunder-- that actually do. I think what I'm hearing today,\nand it's really sinking in, is that a great many people\neither partially or completely misunderstand you. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll put myself\nin the partially category. DAVID GOGGINS: Big time. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBecause I thought it was about just forward\ncenter of mass, carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot. But it's the stick. DAVID GOGGINS: It's the stick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nit's being haunted. And you know, I do have examples\nfrom my own life, which is not what today is about,\nabout being really afraid and then turning things around. My biggest fear is\ngetting comfortable. I do not have as much of\na stick-oriented approach. But today's conversation's\nchanging the way I think. I'm not going to\nstep away from this and think, OK, there are\n25 neural circuits that can explain 10 of the things\nthat David's talking about. And what I'm thinking\nabout is the fact that everybody has a brain. They have a mind. Forget the brain. The brain's just the\nphysical structure. But what that manifests, what\nthat creates is the mind. And everybody has that. So I do believe that\neveryone has the capacity to do what you're talking\nabout at some level. I also will be the\nfirst to confess that I think you\nare highly unusual. Let's just say maybe even n\nof 1, as we say in science. Sample size of one. Somebody who has created\nthis process for themselves and keeps them in\nthis-- themselves in this forward center\nof mass with the stick battering the back of\ntheir head all the time. Highly unusual. But this internal\nmedicine cabinet that you're talking\nabout building up, true confidence, not needing\nanything from the outside, I like to think that\npeople want that. They want to be known. They're afraid. But that they want to be\nknown for who they really are and that you're describing\nthe path to do this. And I will say I'm immensely\ngrateful that you're talking to us this\nway today about things that you've talked about before. But we're hitting it a little\ndifferently, I like to think. DAVID GOGGINS: Very differently. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nwhat you're talking about is a process. It's verbs. It's all verbs. DAVID GOGGINS: All action. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nit's not about success. It's more, actually,\nabout keeping that friction dialed to 10. And no energy drink,\nno supplement. People often misunderstand me. They think-- like, I'm big\non people getting sunlight in the morning so they\nset their circadian rhythm and get better sleep and\nso they can-- et cetera. But then people always\nthink-- they go straight to the supplements. What should I take? And then, of\ncourse, people think I'm all about supplements. And supplements are\none piece for me. But it's like tiny fraction\ncompared to the doing, the do's and don'ts. DAVID GOGGINS:\nThat's why I didn't want to talk about that today. That's why I'm glad\nwe're talking about this. This is it. This is it. Like, the brain is the most\npowerful weapon in the world. And it's crazy how a kid\nthat wasn't real smart, I was forced to\ngo only internal. External had to go away. The external world\nhad to go away. In living so deep inside\nmyself, it was me in this brain and figuring out how\nthis thing works. And so many people are doing\nexactly that, the supplements, the this, the that. And I agree, it helps. But once you figure\nout your brain, you become unstoppable\nto almost anything. Yeah, you can't beat death. You can't whatever, whatever. Your brain is amazing. Once you feed it the right\nconversation, the right mental nutrients, the right\nmental supplements, the right internal\ndialogue at the right time with the right hit, with the\nright proof of what you've done in the past, and\nyou send that right to the right circuit, dude,\nyou're a fucking beast. A beast. But once again, you just\ncan't read about it. You can't sit back\nand be a theorist. You have to be a\nfucking practitioner. And in that practice is where\nthat becomes proof-positive of what I'm saying. It's like, god, David\nGoggins is blowing my mind. What is this? He's not crazy. And so many people,\na lot of people, have listened to\nme the right way. And they come back, and they're\nlike, I'm totally on board. It happened. It happened. I'm like, it'll keep going,\nman, if you keep doing it. But that is it, man. There's no sun. There's no glory. There's no carrot. There's no victory. But there is all of it in one. I just can't explain it\nreal well to people, man. But what you get the\nother end is something that you're always found. You're never lost anymore. Doesn't mean the\njourney is easy. Doesn't get any easier. But you're always found. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that. I just want to hover\non that for a sec the same way we hovered\non haunted and the stick. I think people feel lost. I've certainly felt lost at\ntimes in my life, many times. And yeah, there's that thing. I don't think there's a\nneuroscience or a psychology term for it. Someone will put it in the\ncomments and say, oh yeah, that's what so-and-so said. But like you said, we're not\ntrying to be theoretical here. We're trying to be practical. The business of finding\nyourself and knowing, oh. But it's sort of like I'm\nsafe because I'm in danger, and I've been in danger\nbefore, and I got myself out. It always seems to\ncome back to verbs. Again, I don't have\na language for this. For once, I'm lost for words. There's like-- it's about\na process, the algorithm. And the reason-- here, I'm just\nkind of trying to make sure I'm understanding\nthings correctly. One of the reasons why\nit must be uncomfortable for you to be who\nyou are publicly is because people want to focus\non the running or the swearing. And by the way, the\nswearing is welcome. I'll tell you, I came\nup through laboratories where all three people I\nworked for swore a lot. But there was one rule. I couldn't swear at people. So my graduate advisor,\nbrilliant woman, unfortunately, she died\nearly, they all died early-- I'm the common denominator. I had that internalized\nfor a long time. Anyway, she said, but if you\nswear at people, you're out. But you can swear\nas much as you want. So that's the rule I have. It's like, you can swear\nas much as you want. Just don't swear at people. And if you swear at people,\nbetter be ready to fight. Definitely not\ngoing to fight you. So you can swear at\nme, get away with it. But the fact of the\nmatter is that it must be frustrating that people-- because I know\npeople go, oh, it's all about supplements\nand ice baths. Listen, I like supplements. I love supplements\nand ice baths. But that's not the full picture. It's just a gravitational pull. It's the swearing. It's the running. It's his feet that\nare all messed up. It's the fact that\nhe got a Triton. He's a SEAL guy. Talk about that too. And there's a gravitational\npull for people. And they're missing-- that's\nthe tip of the iceberg, is what I'm realizing. I'm realizing that\ntoday thanks to the way you're phrasing things\nbecause the bigger vessel is all in here. And as you said, how do\nyou put that in a book? DAVID GOGGINS: It's impossible. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nit's highly individual. You do it your way. And you're saying,\neveryone needs to go figure out how to\ndo it their way for them. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. And the thing about\nbeing misunderstood, it's very frustrating, more\nthan I can even imagine. I can't even express\nhow frustrating it is when the cussing\nand everything comes from a place of real. I can't explain what\nI do without it. The passion comes out of me. It's almost like speaking in\ntongues because when you put that much work-- and\npeople go, oh yeah, there's been this basketball\nplayer, this football player, this-- dude. No. No. Everything, everything is work. Everything. And people don't believe it. So when I speak, the\nmotherfucker and the fuck and the shit, that is\nwhat it took for me, what it takes for me, the anger,\nthe passion, the jaw-dropping-- just it takes that\nbecause I'm not that. This is how I look at it, man. What built this guy? Let's imagine being\nin the coldest water you can possibly take. I always go back to\nHell Week with this. I hated that water. Hated it. You're sitting there locked\narms, and you're in the water all the time. And they're bringing you\nin and out of the water, in and out of the water. When you have this\ndialogue in your head, and these people are judging me\noff a freaking 1-minute video, and you're constantly\nyour whole life, when you figured it out\nat 24, that I got to-- I just got to, just\nfucking got to, and this is just going to suck. Every day it's going to suck. And live like that to be better. And I put it this way. I'm in the water. The water is going over my\nhead, the Pacific Ocean. It's freezing. February. Cold as shit. Been through three Hell Weeks. For you to constantly\nwin, win, win, when this voice over\nhere, the real you, is saying get the fuck out\nof here, go, you're nobody. You've always been nobody. And it's true. People don't hear that. That's a true voice. That's a real reality of\nDavid Goggins at 24 years old. It's not a false reality. And then you had to create\nanother voice over here that is saying, you're better\nthan that other voice. And you're in the\nfreezing cold water that both voices don't\nwant to fucking be in. But you win. Then goes from the\nwater to the studying to the running to\nthe losing weight to how you eat to how\nyou function as a man. Every day of your life,\nyou're winning these battles. And then I have normal people\nwho only have one voice. Never created the second voice. The winning voice\nis the second voice. They have one voice. And that's just,\nI'm a piece of shit. And that's all they hear. And then they judge\npeople like me who are out here\ntrying to be better. It's something that\nI can never really-- it's a frustrating\nthing for me because I know the majority of people. I know what goes on in the\nbrain because I studied the mind more than almost-- more than\nyou because I'm a practitioner. So for you to be a piece of\nshit and come out of that, you don't just come out of it. You spend decades studying\nyour mind and the human mind on how it functions in good\nenvironments, bad environments, stressful environments,\npatient environments. You study it all because\nyou had to put all this together to create the\nmind to become successful. So I had to-- it wasn't like\nGod blessed me with this brain. I had to create a mind. And so in doing\nso, I figured out every piece of shit\nhuman being in the world because that's what I was\ngoing off of for myself. So I know why you\ngo on Instagram. I know why you-- because\nyou just have the time. You have the time\nbecause you don't want to put that time\ninto bettering oneself. So I know why I'm misunderstood. I'm misunderstood by people\nwho have plenty of time on their hands to misunderstand\nme because they are exactly where I once was, which is a\nlow-life, lazy piece of shit. And it's the harsh reality\nof people who troll you, who go after you. They have nothing better\nto do with their lives. It's not some after\nschool special. It's the truth. But I once was that way. I know where it all comes from. That's why it's\nfrustrating to me now because I'm not so\nfrustrated at the fact that I'm being trolled. I'm frustrated by\nthe fact that you don't have the\ncourage, the courage to try to be somebody\nbetter than what you're not. And that's the frustrating part. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's interesting because earlier, we were\ntalking about relationships. And you said, in\na very candid way, and I really appreciate\nyou sharing that, that you make sure\nthat the people close to you, your family,\nhas everything they need and that they also\nunderstand that you're going to take what you need to\ncontinue to build you period. DAVID GOGGINS: Period. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIn some ways, it seems you've also included the\ngeneral public in that family. You're saying, listen, I'm\ngoing to give you what you need. I'm going to give you as\nmuch of myself as I can, except I'm going to\nstop right at the line that if I were to\ncross it is going to prevent me from\ncontinuing to build myself. And by the way,\nthis relationship only exists because I\ndon't cross that line. And I think as much as there\nare detractors out there or people that try-- I mean, whatever they're doing\nis pretty feeble, in my mind. I mean, it's like cap\ngun fire, it that. DAVID GOGGINS: Very feeble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So many of us,\nmen and women, old and young, hear something and feel\nsomething in your message. Like, yeah, it\nseems kind of crazy. Gosh. Doesn't he ever just relax? What about his sleep? Look at his feet. He's going to-- he's\ngoing to injure himself. Listen, I'll be very direct. I got friends who were in the\nTeams who just go, what's he going to do when he can't run? And I know the answer\nis keep running. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nit's more comfortable for people, even\nhigh achievers-- DAVID GOGGINS: Especially\nhigh achievers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to\nbelieve that if you took one thing away, that\nit would all go away. It's absolutely clear that's\nnot the case with you. I'm 100% convinced. I just know that because\nwe're talking about this. DAVID GOGGINS: Do you\nknow how many times I haven't been able to run? Two heart surgeries. Multiple knee surgeries. And after every knee\nsurgery, they said, you're not going to run again. And I'm fine with that. There's no running up here, bro. None. This was what it was all about. That's what they lost. What if you can't run? Give a fuck. It was never about running. Why do you think I run? It's the worst thing. I hate doing it\nmore than anything. Hence the willpower. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Your anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex DAVID GOGGINS:\nHence the willpower. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--would start to regress if you loved running. DAVID GOGGINS: Think about it. Every day, I wake up. I don't just run\na mile, two miles. It's the one thing I\nhate the most to do. And I do it like I love it. 250, 260, 300-mile\nruns at one time. No sleep. And every step, when I get\nto the-- think about this. I get to the fucking start\nline cussing at Jennifer. Why the fuck am I here? I hate this shit. After 70-some hours of\nrunning, every fucking question I ever had is answered. Every question I\nhad is answered. I capped success. People go, what do you\nmean, you capped success? For me to be who I am-- so when I go smokejump, I smoke\njump three to four months out of the year, sometimes five. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could\nyou, just for those that aren't educated\nabout-- just give us a brief description\nof what smokejumping entails. DAVID GOGGINS: So basically,\nyou jump into fires. Not into them, but you jump by\nfires that people can't get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So out\nof planes and helicopters. DAVID GOGGINS:\nRight, out of planes. I parachute. It's all parachuting. So you parachute\nout of airplanes. And then you fight the fire, you\nand sometimes four other guys or maybe eight other\nguys, guys and gals. And you're putting\nthis fire out. So I lose millions of dollars\nevery summer to do this. It blows people's minds. Why the hell are you doing this? ANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nyou're breathing soot. DAVID GOGGINS: I'm\nbreathing soot. Knees are jacked up. Hitting the ground. Hurting. Whatever. Talking to normal people,\nthey'll never get it, so I don't even\nexplain it to them. But this is why-- this is\nwhy I call it capped success. I'm talking financial success. For me to continue having that\nwillpower, the second I just become a speaking\nmonkey and travel around and speaking gigs 12\nmonths out of the year, put camps on, do this, put on\nlectures, get supplement lines and do this and write\nmore books and shit, I've ruined the exact thing\nI worked on my entire life. And while I didn't\nknow it until the day, but something\nalways told me, this is a very, very, very\nperishable skill, this willpower that you have, because I do have\na willpower that I have never seen in anybody in my life. It is a haunting force\nthat just keeps me going. And I know that\nthat is my strength. If you have that-- so that's\nworth every dime I've ever made in my life is the fact\nI can look a man in the eye finally and have a\nreal conversation without going like\nthis because I'm lying, or I'm a piece of shit. Or I know-- you\nknow how a person-- and so many people do this shit. They're talking to you\non who they want to be. They're lying to you. And they walk away-- I've done it so many times. You walk away like, god, man. If I could just\ntell them the truth. Why the hell can't I\njust tell him the truth? Know how good it\nfeels for me now to look at you in\nyour eye and every man I see because women\nwon't get this. Women will not get this. Man to man, that\nman shit, when you look another man\nin the eye, and you know that everything you're\nfucking saying is real, and it comes from a real\nworking place, something that you earned, it's the\nbest feeling in the world. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can\nsay that actually happened. Like, I know with certainty what\nI'm saying actually happened. DAVID GOGGINS:\nActually happened. Who I am and who\nI say I am, I am. No more lies. No more skirting the truth. No more bullshit. And that is worth every dime\nI've ever made in my life. And I swear to God on that. Every dime I've ever made in\nmy life, building who I built, so I capped success\nbecause I know that if I ever go 12\nmonths out of the year and don't put several--\nevery day, I'm going at it. But several months\nout of the year, I go right back to\nground zero, which means I'm just fucking David Goggins. No Goggins. No carry boats,\nfucking logs bullshit. It's just pick up that\nfucking Pulaski and dig. Hey, get that fucking pump. Walk down a mile. Put it in the fucking water. Mosquitoes beating--\nyou're just David Goggins. You're nobody because\nthat's where my growth is. That's where my\nwillpower comes from. And that's where it stays. That's why when I talk to\nyou now-- and can't nobody talk like this, dude. People don't talk with\nthis kind of passion because it ain't there. It ain't there. They're regurgitating some\nshit from 30 fucking years ago. I'm regurgitating\nshit from an hour ago. Hour ago. Come on, man. It's just be real. And I can't be on\nthese podcasts. I can't talk to anybody\nwithout being real. I'll go away. I'll just go away\nbecause I can't give you what I want to give you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nsaid perishable skill. I think that's\nanother set of words I want to highlight because\nskill implies behavior. And when we were just\ntalking a second ago about the deep, true bedrock\nsense of confidence that comes from looking\nsomeone in the eye and telling somebody\nsomething that you absolutely know it's true\nbecause it happened, you're talking about actions. Not talking about perceptions. You're not talking about\nwhat you believe happened. You know it happened. And there's something really\nconcrete about actions. I mean, that's what's\nso interesting is we're talking about the mind. But actions are the\nmanifestation of the mind. And the stuff that just stays\nin here, people die with that. It doesn't go anywhere. Long ago, somebody said-- I forget what the context was. It was a neuroscientist. He said, most emotions,\nthey're just emotions. They're just in there. You don't have to do\nanything with them. And I think certain emotions\nyou want to do something with. But I think people forget this. They feel miserable,\nlike they're going to dissolve into a\npuddle of their own tears. No one ever died\nfrom an emotion. But they feel-- they overwhelm\nus as if it's a tidal wave. It's going to pull us\nunder and drown us. It's so interesting to me\nbecause I think what people-- listen, you have a\ngravitational pull. People can feel the energy. I think, yes, you're\neither completely badly or partially understood. There's only one\nguy on the planet that truly understands you. I think there's one\nwoman, Jennifer, who probably understands you\nas much as anyone's going to. And then the rest of us\nare kind of grasping, trying to figure it out. But you're saying, go inward. So first, go inward. And then it's actions. Inward and actions. Now, the inward\npiece is something I'd like to just spend a little\nbit of time on because there are a couple of characters\nfrom history, people that were in concentration camps. Nelson Mandela. I mean, I'm not sure he\nhad Instagram in there. I'm pretty sure he didn't. And I don't think there\nwas anyone coaching him on, hey, you're going\nto get out someday. And actually, you're going\nto lead an entire country. I'm pretty sure that's\nnot how it worked. He had to find it here. He had to find it\nbetween his ears. And there are other examples. But that's an important one. So the process of going\ninward, does it, for you-- and here, I will\nask for suggestions because I think people want-- there are those of us who\nwant to build this skill. Wall yourself off. Phone off for big portions\nof the day, perhaps. Texting off. The requests, the\nthis, the that. Anyone that knows you\nknows that-- we've communicated a few\ntexts, but most of it comes through a filter. She's great. She knows you. And she knows how to\nprotect your time. DAVID GOGGINS: And that\nhurts people's feelings. People get mad about that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHey, God bless-- God bless you, Jennifer. Cutting oneself off,\nwhen you're in there, you say it's just you. And the voices that come\nup are not pleasant. And then at some point,\nit converts to action. OK. What is the process\nof picking the action? That's the piece that\nI feel like there's, like, a bridge to build here,\nif you can, if you would. DAVID GOGGINS: So the action\nbeing, like, what's next? ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, so when you go to sleep at night,\nwhen that happens, you know what you're\ngoing to do the next day? It's pre-planned? DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. It's always the same thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're\nnot building it on the fly. DAVID GOGGINS: No. Nothing's on the fly. So how it works\ninternally for me is I'll put it exactly how it is. I'm an artist. And every day, I'm\npainting Mona Lisa. Every day. And but it's a different one. It's not the same painting. So every day I wake up, even\nthough I'll do the same thing, it takes a different\nway to get there. So every day, in my mind,\nI'm going through my mind. I'm just like-- and a good\npainter will not just paint. He needs to create. And you can't create with\nphones and everything going around you. So you got to\nblock yourself off. You only do two\npodcasts in a year. You block yourself off. And you're painting\nthis thing inside. And you're going through\nall these different colors of paint and everything else. And you can only figure\nout the right painting if you spend the correct\namount of time in your brain. So every single\nday, I'm literally going through my mind,\nand I'm painting. I'm creating this masterpiece. And the masterpiece\nis always myself. And but to do that, you\ncannot have any distractions because if you're talking to an\nartist and he's trying to think about the next\npainting, he can't. It's impossible to\nlisten to you and listen to what your mind and body\nare telling you we must do. Because people\ndon't do enough of. They don't do any of it. They don't have passion. They lack passion,\ndrive, determination because you haven't\nspent time with yourself. Your mind will tell\nyou what is next. But you haven't\nspent the time to go, all right, let me\njust figure this out. You're looking for let me Google\nthis, and let me Google that, and let me-- you're not\ngoing to find it there because there's billions\nof people in this world. And they're all supposed\nto be individuals. But we have a pack mentality. That's why you're\nso fucking lost. Why am I so unique? I'm being exactly what the\nfuck I was supposed to be. I ain't follow shit. And when I did follow shit,\nI was like everybody else. The second I said, OK, man, hang\non, dude, you don't like this, you don't like this, you\ndon't like this, who are you, David Goggins? Who are you supposed to be? Miraculously, all\nthese things just-- I couldn't even-- the list of\nshit I had to do, just, wham. It's like, fuck. OK. Wow. Once you sit down with\nyourself and say, OK, I don't want to be like\nMichael Jordan or Jim Brown-- they're both born\non my birthday. So I looked at their birthday. I said, oh, maybe I\ncan be one of the-- I can't. I'm going to be David\nfucking Goggins. And that looks like this. It just came. Everything flooded. So every single day\nof my life, there's a different thing that\ncomes up that I have to do. But no one knows what to do\nbecause everybody else is following steps. Like the Republican\nand Democratic parties. I'm not political-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Neither am I. DAVID GOGGINS: --at\nall for this reason. Republicans are going\nto vote Republican. Democrats are going\nto vote Democrat. You're not even a human\nfucking being, bro. No way all you fuckers agree\nwith all the same fucking shit. And I know I don't. So once you figure out\nyourself and who you are, all the answers come. So every night, a different\npainting is being painted. And it's a beautiful\npainting for myself. I'm like, OK. That's it. It may look the same\nto most motherfuckers. But the end result is\nvery fucking different. That's why my-- if you look\nat what I've done in 49 years, it's more than most people\nwill ever do in their life because they were\na race car driver. And that's what they did. They drove a fucking car. It's great. I was all kind of shit\nbecause that's exactly what the painting was saying to do. It's what the mind\nwas saying to do. Wasn't saying just drive a car,\nso then that race car driver didn't know what the fuck to do. He retires from being a race\ncar driver, and they're lost. People go, how are you still-- I don't get it. Dude, you're never\ngoing to fill your list. But you never found your\nlist because it never was presented in front of\nyou because your head was cluttered with shit because\nyou never just stopped for lots of minutes, lots\nof years, and just said, all right, it's me and you. Let it go. And it just-- bam. It's right there. It's right there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nnot a psychologist, as I mentioned before. But I'm going to venture\na hypothesis here. I think that you've mastered the\nprocess of internal dialogue. But when I say dialogue, I\nthink most people think, oh, the inner voice, the chatter. But that's just one\nhalf of a dialogue. A dialogue is a two-way street. So I completely agree because\nI know from experience that when we go inward,\noftentimes, we hear things, if we're really honest with\nourselves, it's like, oh no, I don't want to\nthink about that. No. And then we start\nlooking outward. Or we start trying to shift\nour attention or distract. And there are a\nmillion reasons that are handed to us, excuses, and\nseemingly good justifications to be able to do that. But dialogue is\na two-way street. And it hit me\nwhile you were just saying what you\nwere saying, I was paying very close attention. And I realized David Goggins\nis talking about the voice that comes up, including the\nterrible stuff that no one wants to hear about themselves\nfrom themselves. But then he's also got\nthe dialogue down where he knows the counter voice. He goes, yeah, you're right. And so I'm going to do this. Or maybe no, remember this. You're in a dialogue, a\ntwo-way dialogue in there, not a one-way chatter dialogue. There are books written\nby famous psychologists about chatter, trying to\nshift your internal narrative. You're like, bring\nthe internal-- the internal narrative, that's\nwhat going inward is about. But it's not one voice. Again, there's a hypothesis. And I'm not claiming\nto be all-knowing. Lord knows I'm not all-knowing. But you've mastered\nthe dialogue. And if there are three voices,\nstrong, medium, and weak, in there, you're like,\nlet's all come to the table. So you've got a symphony\nof voices in there that are all you, that\nyou know to be you. And you know how to have\nthose convers-- you're not afraid to be in\nthose conversations. And then you know what the\noutcome of that committee decision is, and you put\nit into real-world action. And the world only\nsees the action. DAVID GOGGINS: That's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd only you can know your internal dialogue. And only I can know\nmy internal dialogue. And the only way to,\nquote unquote, \"know it\" is to spend a hell\na lot of time there. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime. Like, think about it. For me to be sitting\nhere in front of you, you're not going to\ncall 300-pound Ecolab guy to come sit here. You might. I don't know. Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. DAVID GOGGINS: Probably not. Think about this. What we teach people is\nkind, kindness to yourself. Do you think if I\ntaught myself kindness-- and I agree with it. God, so many people-- so many\npeople take me out of context, it's ridiculous. Take it however the fuck\nyou want to take it. When I was 300\npounds, where do you think that conversation\nwould that got me if I spoke kindness to myself? I'll tell you where it gets me. Right back to 7-Eleven with\nanother box of mini chocolate donuts and a\nchocolate milkshake. That's the one voice. That's the one voice\nthat most of us have that you're talking about. If you don't have a conversation\nin there, the other voice that you create that says,\nOK, how does this look? Looks very ugly. That kind conversation for\nme went away a long time ago, which is why the dialogue\nis now what you see. A lot of action. Because most people have\ninaction because there's one person talking. And that one person\nis always leading you down the same\npath, the path that makes you feel very comfortable\nand happy with yourself. The second you create the\nother voice, there's conflict. Just battles. Just wars. Just defeat. One thing I learned, and\nI taught myself this, and people go, I don't\nunderstand what you're saying, I'm going to try to\nbreak it down real quick. I didn't teach\nmyself victory first. I taught myself failure. I taught myself how to fail. And people like,\nthat's so depressing. Is it? When you're 300 pounds and\nyou can't read and write and you're fucked up,\nyou know how many times you're going to fucking\nfail on that process? So if you don't know how to\nfail, there is no victory. I never talked about\nwinning because I knew the path to\nwinning was going to be years of failing first. So I taught myself\nhow to fail properly. No one teaches you\nhow to fucking fail. But if you're going out\nfor insurmountable fucking odds that make absolutely\nno fucking sense, a Black kid that can't\nswim, 300 pounds-- going to be a Navy SEAL. OK. You better teach yourself\nhow to fail first because if you sit in\nfailure for too long, you will never come out of it. So the first part\nof my success was learning how to fail properly. And then eventually, I started\ngetting a few victories. But that's what\npeople don't get. When you have buried yourself\nin such a deep fucking hole, you better first talk\nabout the failures you're going to have first. And that's when that\nother voice comes up. It tells you, we've\ngot to do something. But it also tells\nyou, boy, I'm not going to lie to you, Goggins. You're in for a\nfucking climb, bro. You're going to get\nyour ass handed to you, made fun of, the outside\nnoise, the inside noise. Both voices are going\nto be fucking telling you to go fuck yourself. You are in for hell, bro. I am. So I better learn to fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo this is what you mean when you say that\nwhatever anyone says, it's insignificant? DAVID GOGGINS:\nInsignificant as fuck. ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's the cap gun fire because it's just like\nit-- because the voice in your own head is far worse. And I should say, sorry, one\nof the voices in your head. I'm being very detailed,\nalmost surgical about that because I think\nthis thing about inner dialogue we think is one voice. But you're making it\nclear it's many voices. DAVID GOGGINS: It is. And the thing about it is,\nyou have to be really-- and sometimes all the\nvoices are telling you the wrong shit, man. But through years, years, not a\npodcast or listening to a book or reading a book,\nyears of sacrifice, of suffering, of diligent\npinpoint fucking work on what you want\nto do for yourself, not like, oh, let me\njust do a bunch of shit. Let me-- I want to be\nin every task possible. No. Pinpoint what I want\nto do with my life. What happens is you have\nall these voices that are telling you\nyou're fucked up, and this is going to be hard. But for some reason, you put\nso much practice into you that you can ignore\nevery one of them that are telling you you're not\ngoing to fucking make it. And still be able\nto fucking make it because you have put\nthe practice in that you know this is the process. It's such a daunting task that\nall the voices are saying no. But you still have\nthe conviction that I know I can do this. And that's what it took\nfor me to get here. 20, 30 years ago, I had this-- 35 or whatever it was,\n25 years ago, pipe dream. And ever since then, every voice\nwas like, you're a fucking nut. But when you put that practice\nin every day, you lace them up. And I mean, run. It's just a metaphor for life. When you lace them\nmotherfuckers up every day, pretty soon, you win. Pretty soon, you'll fucking win. If you have the courage and\nthe heart and the dedication and the mindset of everybody\ncan go fuck themselves, I know what I know. I've listened to\nmyself enough to know. I know what I know. None of you can hear\nwhat I'm hearing. And that's what people\ndon't do enough of. They don't listen\nto their journey. They listen to\neverybody else's shit. Before you know it, I'm crazy. But if I'm so fucking crazy,\nwhy am I so successful? How that happen? But I'm so misguided\nand fucked up. And don't listen to him. Why am I the only one to\ndo a whole bunch of shit? Why am I a trailblazer? Why? How is that possible? How can you be fucked up and\nalso self-made at the same fucking-- no. No. Obviously, you're not looking\nat the truth in front of you. The truth in front\nof you is it sucks. It's painful. It's fucking mind-numbing. And that is the truth. And that's why a\nlot of people don't like listening to me because\nthis is what it takes, creating another voice and\nsometimes going at it alone. All the time going at it\nalone because no one's going to believe in you. And that's that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I'm\nabout to say is not conjecture. And I can say that\nwith confidence because I did a\nfour-episode guest series with a brilliant\npsychiatrist, a guy named Paul Conti. He's from Trenton. He's a Stanford,\nHarvard-trained guy. He's also got a lot\nof street in him. He's had his own\nhardship, real hardship. He's brilliant. And he said something\nthat I'll never forget, which is, we think that\nthe forebrain, the part of our brain that creates\nstrategy, et cetera, is the supercomputer. He said, no, no, no,\nno, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. He's like, the\nsupercomputer of the brain is the unconscious mind. It's the part of our mind that's\ncontrolling most everything. And most people,\nunfortunately, don't do the work to understand\nhow their unconscious is controlling them. And that's a scary\nthing, this idea, like your mind is\ncontrolling you. And I'm not going to get\ninto the free will debate. I believe in at least some will. I believe what you're describing\nand this internal dialogue, I think you have access\nto your unconscious mind by listening to the\ndialogue, going inward. We know this is true in sleep,\nin dreams, in meditation, and just by shutting out\neverything else, shutting out all the external\nnoise, which is filled with things that pull us to it. Noise makes it sound bad, but\nit's the gravitational pull of all the things that allow\nus to distract ourselves without knowing. The ice cream. The have a cookie. The Merry Christmas. The unconscious\nmind, this huge piece of the iceberg underneath that\nPaul calls the supercomputer, he's saying that with\nknowledge as a neurobiologist, psychiatrist, psychologist,\nso he really knows, that's the piece that if\none does real introspection, he calls it the cupboards. You got to look\nin the cupboards. And it's often really scary\nwhat you find in there. And most people are\njust like, I don't even want to know the\ncupboards are there. But you're pulling all\nthe cupboard doors open. And then you're-- and you're\nextremely deliberate with what gets put into action. You're not just going,\noh, like, I'm pissed, so I'm going to act pissed. Or I'm tired, so I'm\ngoing to act tired. It's you're picking very\ncarefully what to do. And that's a process that\nI'm guessing came to you. Does it come to you\nas a, OK, it makes sense why running makes sense. It makes sense why\nsmokejumping makes sense. So it seems like a huge\nportion of your time is spent understanding yourself\nand making sense to you. And so when people\ndon't understand you, it's got to be extra frustrating\nbecause most people don't understand themselves. So then we're all running\naround going, you're this, and you're that because\nmost people are just unwilling to look inward. And I'm including\nmyself, by the way. I mean, I've done a fair\namount of introspection. But I'm inspired today, that\nword, inspired, but it's true, motivated to start going inward\nfurther because it is scary. It's like, we don't know\nwhat's in those cupboards, and it's terrifying, especially\nbecause we don't know. DAVID GOGGINS: And those are\nthe first ones to open up. And like you talked\nabout, you got to go through those cupboards. I do spring cleaning\nevery fucking day in those dark cupboards. Those dark cabinets are the\nones I start with first. That's the real me, man. That's the real me. That's why I'm not ashamed. I don't hide. I used to hide. I don't hide anymore. He's exactly right. I don't know all the\nfucking science behind shit. I know what I know. That's why I don't listen\nto anybody anymore. I don't listen to shit. I think most people are\nfull of shit because I know. I know the deep, dark secrets\nof those fucking cupboards. It's ugly, man. And every day, I'm\ntalking to them. Every day, I'm cleaning them. I'm cleaning them,\nand I'm talking to the same demons that came\nout of those fucking cupboards as I'm cleaning them. Sometimes they go right\nback in them again. It's not easy. And this is why\nmost of us just-- why I am misunderstood\nbecause what comes out of those cabinets\nthat I'm cleaning, sometimes they see on Instagram. Sometimes they'll\nsee it in a podcast. Sometimes they see\nit in this one. I turn people off. Open up your own cabinets. And then go talk about it. Let me see how pretty it looks. Let me see how pretty you sound. Let me see how put\ntogether your words are. I bet you a fuck or a\nmotherfucker comes out because for you to go\nback in there again to clean the same fucking\ncabinet that the demon came out of takes some big balls, bro. To do it every day of your life. To go back in there and spring\nclean every day, not once a fucking year,\nonce every decade. Every day you know\nit gets dusty. And every day, you don't\nstart with the victories. You don't go, oh, this is nice. Look at my-- look at\nmy I love me wall. Let me clean up. This is a little dusty. No. I go right for the things that\nare going to keep me buried. And I go right there first\nbecause if I don't clean those out first, the\nday doesn't start. So what are you\nsaying to me is truth. And like I told you\nmany times today, I can never figure out how to\nexplain this shit to people because I'm not neuro nothing. I'm just a guy that said, OK,\nwe got to start in the dungeon. And we got to stay here\nfor the rest of our lives. For you to become\nsuccessful, the dungeon is a place that has to be clean. And it's the\nscariest place to be. That's why I'm\nmisunderstood because I'm speaking from the dungeon. That's why I am\nsuccessful because I go there every damn day. And that is the\ntruth, what he says. It's the exact truth. Those cabinets are\nfucking dusty, dirty, and scary as shit. Broken glass, fucking\ndark, spiders, cobwebs. But most of all,\nyour biggest fears, the biggest things that put\nyou in a fucked up place you are today are in there. That's why we all like\nto keep them shut. You like to lock them up. Act like they never happened. That's why you never grow. You never improve. You never have\nreal conversations like we're having right now. Never. Never. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. Let's not-- no, no, no. Let's not go there. I talked to so many\npeople who tell me that. Let's talk about this. Because they'll tell me, but\nthey can only say it once. And they'll say it in passing. They won't get deep\nin the weeds with it. Like, you can't just clean it. Motherfucker, you got to\nspit shine that motherfucker. You got to relive it,\nevery fucking detail of it. You can't just be like, oh\nyeah, yeah, my dad beat me. And it is what it is. It ain't is what it\nis, motherfucker. It's killing you. It's taken over your\nwhole fucking life. But that's the conversation. Yeah, my dad beat-- but\nI'm fine now, though. I'm good. OK. All right. No, you ain't. You ain't fine. You ain't fine. This is real talk. People don't have that. So your boy's right. 100% right. Scary as shit. It's scary as shit. But it makes you who\nyou're supposed to be. And that's the test. We forget. We think we're supposed to\nbreathe air and have kids and pay the bills and shit. But what's this life about? That makes no sense. We're being tested, my friend. Tests come when you\nhave not studied. Tests come when you think\nthat you're in a great place. That's the test. The test is every\nday of your life. And most of us fail\nbecause we don't know why we're here because\nwe don't go inward to say, oh. You gave me a lot\nof shit to fix, man. And this test sucks. But then you start. ANDREW HUBERMAN: David Goggins. I don't think I\ncould add to that. I know I can't. Thank you for sharing\nwhat you shared today. I mean, as much as your\nprocess or anyone's process can't be completely\nunderstood from the outside, you gave us a real\nwindow into this thing, this process that you-- as you said, God put it on you. I believe in God too. People can believe\nwhat they want. But somehow, your life, God gave\nyou these challenges early on. And then there was a point\nwhere you went internal. And like you said,\nyou developed a skill. But it's a perishable skill. And you clearly\nlive in the process of opening those cupboards,\nreopening those cupboards, trying to spit shine\nthose cupboards, understanding that they're\nnever, ever really done, but that you can gain ground\non them, that you can win day after day after day. And you really shared a\nlot of concrete things that I know people\nare going to be able to apply if they choose. And I agree with you. I think most people\nwill be like, whoa. That was a lot. It's heavy. I think I want to just kind of\nbake myself in Netflix and Chex Mix instead. But there's also the\nreality that there are men and women, boys and\ngirls who hear that and go, OK, and start cracking\nthe cupboards open. And I just know\nthat for myself, I'm extremely grateful that\nyou're willing to put it all out there. You're so brutally honest,\nso brutally authentic. That word authenticity\ngets thrown around so much. And I can tell you that for me\nand for everybody else, that's really what resonates. So whether or not you want\nto, whether or not it's the purpose behind it or not,\nyou're lighting the path. So thank you. DAVID GOGGINS:\nRespect Thank you. Thanks for having me.

[MUSIC PLAYING] \n", "response": "### SUMMARY:\n\nIn this episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, hosts David Goggins. David is a retired Navy SEAL, ultramarathon runner, former Guinness World Record holder for pull-ups, and bestselling author of \"Can't Hurt Me\" and \"Never Finished.\" The discussion delves into David's challenging childhood, his transformative journey, and his mindset for self-discipline. They also explore scientific aspects of willpower and how David uses internal dialogue to overcome constant challenges.\n\n### IDEAS:\n\n1. The concept of transforming one's life through intense self-discipline and inner dialogue.\n2. Understanding the importance of embracing challenges and discomfort to build personal growth.\n3. The role of willpower as a skill that can be developed and is essential for extraordinary achievements.\n4. Recognizing the value of internal struggle and continuous effort over seeking external validation.\n5. Importance of understanding and working with one's unconscious mind to unlock potential.\n6. The \"haunting\" effect of past experiences as a driver for current behaviors and decisions.\n7. Goggins' methodology of facing his fears and failures head-on as a means to build confidence.\n8. The concept of creating a \"medicine cabinet\" within the mind filled with personal achievements and mental tools.\n9. Emphasizing the significance of real-world actions and experiences over theoretical knowledge.\n10. The need to regularly \"clean the cupboards\" of one's mind to confront and manage inner demons and fears.\n11. Acknowledging the perishable nature of skills such as willpower, which require continuous usage and reinforcement.\n12. The idea that most emotions are manageable and do not require action; instead, focus on deliberate actions.\n13. The discussion about the importance of planning and knowing oneself to make informed life choices.\n14. Understanding the neuroscience behind motivation and willpower, including the anterior mid-cingulate cortex's role.\n15. The notion that true self-confidence comes from accomplishing things that only the individual knows to be true.\n\n### QUOTES:\n\n1. \"The only way to grow is how to look at yourself and say, 'OK, what the fuck I have to do to get somewhere?'\u201d\n2. \"I don't have time for some of [the rest and recovery]. To extract what I had to extract, something had to give.\"\n3. \"The second you start with the small building blocks, before you know it, man, you become something that it doesn't even make sense to most people.\"\n4. \"The biggest misunderstanding about David Goggins of all time... is like whether you believe in God or not... he put this lab rat, which is me, on this planet and said let me fucking see what a beat up, abused kid who can barely learn, barely learn, who has a twisted body, messed up genetics, sickle cell, this and that, let me give him everything that pretty much disqualifies you from the military.\"\n5. \"What builds a human being is you start with the small building blocks. And before you know it, man, you become something that it doesn't even make sense to most people.\"\n6. \"I'm not what you want in a man. That said, I give it all away. What I do need is to make sure that that willpower is worked on every fucking day and every night for the rest of my life.\"\n7. \"To grow that thing... how do you grow it? Do it, and do it, and do it, and do it. That's the hack. The hack is going to fucking suck.\"\n8. \"You got to relive it, every fucking detail of it. You can't just be like, 'Oh, yeah, yeah, my dad beat me. And it is what it is.' It ain't is what it is, motherfucker.\"\n9. \"Everything I've done in 49 years, it's more than most people will ever do in their life because they were a race car driver. And that's what they did. They drove a fucking car. It's great. I was all kind of shit because that's exactly what the painting was saying to do.\"\n10. \"Your brain is amazing. Once you feed it the right conversation, the right mental nutrients, the right mental supplements, the right internal dialogue at the right time with the right hit, with the right proof of what you've done in the past, and you send that right to the right circuit, dude, you're a fucking beast.\"\n11. \"Think about it, for me to have a family, I gotta make sure that you realize I'm going to give you everything you need. So when you start bitching at me, I'm going to say, look, hang on. I dedicated my life to give you everything you need. I need this time right here for me to be the best I can be.\"\n12. \"That's why a lot of people don't like listening to me because this is what it takes, creating another voice and sometimes going at it alone.\"\n\n### HABITS:\n\n- Frequent and intensive self-dialogue to confront fears and failures.\n- Continuous practice of challenging physical and mental tasks.\n- Planning and execution of daily tasks that induce discomfort for personal growth.\n- Regular introspection to keep the \"cupboards\" of the mind clean.\n- Prioritizing self-improvement and the maintenance of willpower over external distractions.\n- Time management that aligns with the pursuit of personal goals.\n- Embracing the responsibility of being self-reliant and independent.\n\n### FACTS:\n\n- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is involved in willpower and grows larger with focused tasks that are challenging.\n- Building willpower and self-discipline can lead to significant changes in life direction and success.\n- Emotional states and memories stored in the unconscious mind have a powerful influence on behavior.\n- The unconscious mind is considered a supercomputer that governs the majority of our actions and decisions.\n\n### REFERENCES:\n\n- David's books \"Can't Hurt Me\" and \"Never Finished\" were mentioned as part of his narrative and insights.\n- The Huberman Lab podcast and previous episodes were referenced regarding knowledge about supplements and sleep.\n\n### RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Engage in daily activities that challenge you and build your willpower.\n- Spend time alone and in silence to allow for introspection and self-dialogue.\n- Regularly confront and process your past experiences and fears to understand yourself better.\n- Ignore external noise and negativity that distract from personal goals and self-awareness.\n- Embrace hardships as opportunities for growth and learning.\n- Practice self-reliance and independence to foster a strong sense of self.\n- Communicate openly and honestly in relationships about needs and boundaries.\n- Recognize that true success is not just external achievements, but also the internal progress made within oneself."}

Wecausally assessed NNS impacts in humans and their microbiomes in a randomized-controlled trial encom-passing 120 healthy adults, administered saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia sachets for 2 weeks\nin doses lower than the acceptable daily intake, compared with controls receiving sachet-contained vehicle\nglucose or no supplement. As groups, each administered NNS distinctly altered stool and oral microbiomeand plasma metabolome, whereas saccharin and sucralose signi\ufb01cantly impaired glycemic responses.Importantly, gnotobiotic mice conventionalized with microbiomes from multiple top and bottom respondersof each of the four NNS-supplemented groups featured glycemic responses largely re\ufb02ecting those noted inrespective human donors, which were preempted by distinct microbial signals, as exempli\ufb01ed by sucralose.Collectively, human NNS consumption may induce person-speci\ufb01c, microbiome-dependent glycemic alter-ations, necessitating future assessment of clinical implications.\nINTRODUCTION\nOver the past 4 decades, the global prevalence of overweight,\nobesity, and hyperglycemia has markedly increased in both\nchildren and adults, constituting a considerable health threatdue to the association of these conditions with type 2 diabetes\nand cardiovascular disease ( NCD Risk Factor Collaboration,\n2017; Sarwar et al., 2010 ), coupled with substantial economic\nrami\ufb01cations ( Imes and Burke, 2014 ). As sugar consumption is\nstrongly associated with weight gain ( Hu, 2013 ), one of the\nmost common dietary strategies in combating obesity and hy-perglycemia involves dietary sugar replacement with non-nutri-\ntive sweeteners (NNS), such as saccharin, sucralose, aspar-tame, acesulfame-K, and stevia, that do not contain calories\nand are thereby presumed to be inert and not elicit a postpran-\ndial glycemic response. This strategy is immensely popular. Ina survey conducted between 2009 and 2011, 25.1% of children\nand 41.4% of adults in the United States reported consuming\nNNS, a marked increase compared with 1999 ( Sylvetsky et al.,\n2017a ). Over 50% of children reported consumption of NNS in\na multi-national study ( Katzmarzyk et al., 2016 ), whereas coun-\ntries enforcing labeling of sugar-containing products observe a\nll\nCell 185, 3307\u20133328, September 1, 2022 \u00aa2022 Elsevier Inc. 3307high concomitant consumption of NNS-containing products\n(Mart\u0131 \u00b4nez et al., 2020 ).\nNonetheless, the ef\ufb01cacy of this strategy remains uncertain.\nAlthough some randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) reportimprovement in metabolic markers in subjects supplemented\nwith NNS ( Blackburn et al., 1997 ;Ebbeling et al., 2020 ;Katan\net al., 2016 ;Masic et al., 2017 ;Miller and Perez, 2014 ;Tate\net al., 2012 ), other RCTs report neither a detrimental nor a bene-\n\ufb01cial effect ( Ahmad et al., 2020a ;Thomson et al., 2019 ) and do\nnot support the intended bene\ufb01ts of this approach ( Azad et al.,\n2017 ;Lohner et al., 2020 ;Toews et al., 2019 ). Furthermore,\nsome cohort studies ( Azad et al., 2017 ,2020 ;Romo-Romo\net al., 2016 ;Swithers, 2013 ) and RCTs ( Bueno-Herna \u00b4ndez\net al., 2020 ;Dalenberg et al., 2020 ;Lertrit et al., 2018 ;Me\u00b4n-\ndez-Garc\u0131 \u00b4aet al., 2022 ;Romo-Romo et al., 2018 ) counterintui-\ntively suggest that NNS may even contribute to the obesity and\ndiabetes pandemic in some contexts. As many of the studiesassociating NNS with negative impacts on human health areobservational, it is often dif\ufb01cult to interpret their \ufb01ndings due\nto reverse causality (i.e., whether NNS cause weight gain and hy-\nperglycemia, or alternatively whether individuals with these con-ditions consume NNS). The heterogeneity in outcomes and\nmethodology between RCTs further complicates interpretation.\nIn the absence of strong evidence for causality and a clear mech-anism demonstrating how \u2018\u2018metabolically inert\u2019\u2019 substances can\naffect human metabolism, consumption of NNS is still widely\nendorsed by clinicians and dietitians for adults ( Gardner et al.,\n2012 ), although a more cautious approach has been lately rec-\nommended for children ( Johnson et al., 2018 ).\nTo partially circumvent the limitations of human studies,\nfeeding trials in animals are commonly used to causally linkNNS intake with an effect on cardiometabolic diseases. Howev-\ner, although animal studies are less heterogeneous than human\nRCTs, some reported an adverse impact of NNS on metabolichealth ( Abou-Donia et al., 2008 ;Bian et al., 2017a ,2017b ;Colli-\nson et al., 2012 ;Feijo\u00b4et al., 2013 ;Gul et al., 2017 ;Leibowitz et al.,\n2018 ;Mitsutomi et al., 2014\n;Nettleton et al., 2020 ;Olivier-Van\nStichelen et al., 2019 ;Otero-Losada et al., 2014 ;Palmna \u00a8s\net al., 2014 ;von Poser Toigo et al., 2015 ;Shi et al., 2019 ;Suez\net al., 2014 ;Swithers et al., 2008 ;Uebanso et al., 2017 ), whereas\nothers reported a bene\ufb01cial effect or no effect ( Bailey et al., 1997 ;\nParlee et al., 2014 ;Risdon et al., 2020 ;Serrano et al., 2021 ;Tovar\net al., 2017 ).\nThis noted and often confusing heterogeneity between trials\ncould potentially be resolved through consideration of the gut\nmicrobiome. The human gastrointestinal tract harbors trillions\nof microorganisms that play critical roles in multiple aspects ofhuman physiology and pathologies, including cardiometabolic\nhealth ( Fan and Pedersen, 2021 ). Importantly, the assemblage\nof microorganisms varies between individuals (and betweenanimals in different research vivaria), leading to personalized re-\nsponses to diets ( Berry et al., 2020 ;Korem et al., 2017 ;Kovatch-\neva-Datchary et al., 2015 ;Spencer et al., 2011 ;Zeevi et al., 2015 )\nand therapeutics ( Ananthakrishnan et al., 2017 ;Gopalakrishnan\net al., 2018 ;Matson et al., 2018 ;Routy et al., 2018 ;Zmora et al.,\n2018 ). Indeed, NNS have been shown to affect microbial growth\nin culture ( Harpaz et al., 2018 ;Omran et al., 2013 ;Rettig et al.,\n2014 ;Wang et al., 2018 ) and modulate the microbiome of ani-mals ( Abou-Donia et al., 2008 ;Anderson and Kirkland, 1980 ;\nBian et al., 2017a ,2017b ,2017c ;Cheng et al., 2021 ;Chi et al.,\n2018 ;Dai et al., 2021 ;Daly et al., 2014 ;Guo et al., 2021 ;\nHanawa\net al., 2021 ;Harrington et al., 2022 ;Li et al., 2021 ;Lyte et al.,\n2016 ;Mart\u0131 \u00b4nez-Carrillo et al., 2019 ;Nettleton et al., 2019 ,\n2020 ;Olivier-Van Stichelen et al., 2019 ;Palmna \u00a8s et al., 2014 ;Ro-\ndriguez-Palacios et al., 2018 ;Sa\u00b4nchez-Tapia et al., 2020 ;Su\u00a8n-\nderhauf et al., 2020 ;Uebanso et al., 2017 ;Wang et al., 2018 ;\nZheng et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, an NNS-modulated micro-\nbiome is suf\ufb01cient to promote glucose intolerance in germ-free\n(GF) mice ( Nettleton et al., 2020 ;Suez et al., 2014 ), providing a\npossible causal link between NNS, microbiome, and metabolic\nhealth of the host. Although a small pilot study in humans sug-\ngested that the microbiome may constitute a potential determi-nant of a negative effect of saccharin on glycemic response in\nsome individuals ( Suez et al., 2014 ), there is a dearth of evidence\non the effects of NNS on the human microbiome, and the fewavailable studies are inconclusive, with some suggesting an ef-fect ( Frankenfeld et al., 2015 ;Laforest-Lapointe et al., 2021 ;\nMe\u00b4ndez-Garc\u0131 \u00b4a et al., 2022 ), as opposed to others ( Ahmad\net al., 2020b ;Serrano et al., 2021 ;Thomson et al., 2019 ).\nNotably, most of these studies were limited in their ability to\nscreen and exclude individuals already incorporating NNS into\ntheir diets, and their microbiome was pro\ufb01led using 16S rRNAgene sequencing or qPCR of target microbes, which may lack\nsuf\ufb01cient resolution to determine functional and species-level ef-\nfects of NNS on the microbiome.\nHere, we present the result of a multi-arm RCT assessing NNS\neffects on human metabolic health and the microbiome. We\ndemonstrate that both sucralose and saccharin supplementa-tion impairs glycemic responses in strictly non-NNS-consuminghealthy volunteers, an effect that is not observed in non-supple-\nmented control groups. Four different NNS functionally alter the\nmicrobiome. Importantly, by performing extensive fecal trans-plantation of human microbiomes into GF mice, we demonstrate\na causal and individualized link between NNS-altered micro-\nbiomes and glucose intolerance developing in non-NNS-consuming recipient mice.\nRESULTSA randomized controlled interventional clinical trial\nThe trial featured four NNS intervention arms: aspartame,saccharin, sucralose, and stevia. All NNS were given as com-\nmercially available sachets containing glucose as a bulking\nagent (2 sachets/3 times a day), corresponding to 8%, 20%,34%, and 75% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each of\nthe supplemented NNS, respectively (US Food and Drug Admin-\nistration, 2018) (Figures 1 A\u20131C, STAR Methods ). To control for\nthe potential confounding effect of the glucose vehicle, routinelyincorporated into the sachet mixtures, we supplemented partic-\nipants in a \ufb01fth arm with an equivalent amount of glucose (5 g\nday\n/C01). A sixth group did not receive any supplement (no supple-\nment control, NSC). The study consisted of three phases: 7 days\nof baseline measurements of metabolic, metabolomic, and mi-\ncrobial parameters were followed by 14 days of exposure tothe various nutritional interventions, after which supplementation\nwas ceased and participants were followed up for 7 additionalll\n3308 Cell 185, 3307\u20133328, September 1, 2022Article(legend on next page)ll\nCell 185, 3307\u20133328, September 1, 2022 3309Articledays. To determine the effect of NNS on glycemic control, partic-\nipants wore a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) throughout the\n29 days of the trial, and glucose tolerance tests were performed\non pre-determined days. Anthropometrics and blood tests wereconducted on days 0, 14, and 28. Microbiome samples from the\nstool and the oral cavity were collected at pre-determined time\npoints. Participants logged all food intake and physical activityin real time using a dedicated smartphone application. The studydesign is summarized in Figure 1 A.\nBetween 2018 and 2020, we screened 1,375 individuals for\neligibility (see exclusion criteria in STAR Methods ). A unique\nfeature of the trial consisted of inclusion only of participants\nde\ufb01ned as complete NNS abstainers according to a detailed\nfood frequency questionnaire based on NNS-containing prod-ucts on the Israeli market ( STAR Methods ). Indeed, using the\nstringent screening protocol, the vast majority of ineligible candi-\ndates were found to consume NNS, in many cases unknowingly,in line with a similar \ufb01nding in a US cohort ( Sylvetsky et al.,\n2017b ). A total of 120 participants, 20 in each group, successfully\ncompleted the trial and had enough glucose measurements for\nanalysis (for the consolidated standards of reporting trials [CON-SORT] participants \ufb02ow diagram, see Figure 1 B and STAR\nMethods ).Table S1 shows the baseline characteristics of the\ncohort and each group. Participants in all groups were in goodmetabolic health, featuring normal body mass index (BMI),\nwaist-hip ratio, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), C-reactive protein\n(CRP), total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, bloodpressure, heart rate, serum alanine transaminase (ALT), and\naspartate transaminase (AST). 65% of participants were women,\nand the median age was 29.95 (interquartile range [IQR] 26.93\u201335.23). None of the following covariates was signi\ufb01cant in anyof the groups: age, sex, BMI, smoking, and habitual diet\n(Table S2 ).\nSaccharin and sucralose impair glucose tolerance in\nhealthy adults\nAs a standardized measure of glucose tolerance, all participantsperformed oral glucose tolerance tests (GTT) with 50 g of\nglucose consumed in the morning after an overnight fasting on\npre-determined days, twice during weeks 1, 2, and 4, and 3times on week 3 (a total of 9 GTTs). GTTs were performed by par-\nticipants at home, and the CGM recorded interstitial glucose\nevery 15 min, after which the incremental area under the glucosecurve (iAUC) was calculated. Performing GTTs using continuousglucose monitoring at home (rather than inviting the participants\nto perform the GTT at the testing center) enabled to longitudinally\nassess the effect of acute NNS consumption and reduce noise(Bailey et al., 2014 ). Although considerable person-to-person\nheterogeneity was observed in the GTT-iAUC (range 1,225\u2013\n7,458 mg dL\n/C01min/C01), baseline GTTs performed by the same in-dividual were similar and signi\ufb01cantly correlated with each other\n(Spearman r = 0.44, p < 0.0001, Figure 1 D), in line with previous\n\ufb01ndings ( Zeevi et al., 2015 ).\nThe effects of the NNS and controls on glucose tolerance are\nsummarized in Figure 2 . To consider each individual GTT, we\nused two linear-mixed-effects models (LMMs) to assess the\nimpact of NNS consumption over time, either with the sevenGTTs performed during baseline and exposure weeks (modelA) or all GTTs including follow-up (model B; Figure 2 A). Both\nsaccharin and sucralose signi\ufb01cantly elevated glycemic res-\nponse during exposure (model A) compared with glucose vehicle(p = 0.042 and 0.004, respectively) and NSC (p = 0.018 and\n0.001; Figure 2 A). The signi\ufb01cant effect on GTT-iAUC was largely\nlimited to the exposure period (model B saccharin versusglucose p = 0.18 and versus NSC p = 0.21; model B sucralose\nversus glucose p = 0.051 and versus NSC p = 0.059). Aspartame\nand stevia did not show a signi\ufb01cant effect in both models.Importantly, no signi\ufb01cant effect on glucose tolerance wasobserved in the glucose vehicle or NSC groups ( Figure 2 A;\nTable S2 ). To compare the magnitude of the effect between\ngroups, we normalized the iAUC-GTT of each individual withtheir average baseline iAUC-GTT. During the 1st week of expo-\nsure, the normalized glycemic response was signi\ufb01cantly higher\nin the sucralose group compared with the glucose vehicle ( Fig-\nure 2 B, two-way ANOVA & Dunnett p = 0.037) and the NSC\ngroups ( Figure 2 B, p = 0.047) and in the saccharin group\ncompared with the glucose vehicle group ( Figure 2 B, p =\n0.023). The signi\ufb01cantly elevated glycemic response persisted\nduring the 2nd week of exposure compared with either glucose\nvehicle ( Figure 2 C, saccharin p = 0.047, sucralose p = 0.017) or\nNSC ( Figure 2 C, saccharin p = 0.003, sucralose p = 0.002) but\ndeclined toward baseline during follow-up ( Figure 2 D). Impor-\ntantly, despite considerable inter-individual heterogeneity of\nglycemic responses, there were no signi\ufb01cant differences inGTT-iAUCs between the groups at baseline (one-way\nrepeated-measures ANOVA F = 0.67, p = 0.64). As an additional\noutput, we compared each individual with their own baseline(repeated-measures two-way ANOVA & Dunnett\u2019s). Saccharin\nsigni\ufb01cantly elevated glycemic response, starting from the 1st\nweek of exposure ( Figure 2 E, p = 0.0073, iAUC mean difference\n783.5, 95% con\ufb01dence interval [CI] 204.3\u20131,363) and persistingto the 2nd week of exposure (p = 0.0094, mean 811.2, CI 190.6\u2013\n1,432). These differences abated upon cessation of saccharin\nintake (p = 0.39). Sucralose supplementation likewise resultedin signi\ufb01cantly elevated glycemic response during week 1 ( Fig-\nure 2 F, p = 0.018, mean 855.8, CI 134.8\u20131,577) and week 2\n(p = 0.0092, mean 976.3, CI 231.3\u20131,721), which did not persistin the follow-up week (p = 0.34). In contrast, neither aspartame\n(Figure 2 G) nor stevia ( Figure 2 H) had a signi\ufb01cant effect on\nglucose tolerance during the 1st (p = 0.9 and 0.47, respectively)\nFigure 1.

No signi\ufb01cant\neffect on glucose tolerance was observed in the glucose vehicle\ngroup ( Figure 2 I, week 1, p = 0.62, week 2, p = 0.85, follow-up,\np = 0.33) or the NSC group ( Figure 2 J, p = 0.77, 0.41, and\n0.11). The lack of signi\ufb01cant effect in these control groups indi-\ncates that reduced glucose tolerance in the saccharin and sucra-lose groups is not a result of daily supplementation with aglucose-containing mixture (as glucose quantity is comparable\nbetween the vehicle and NNS groups, STAR Methods ) or the\nexperimental protocol, which was identical in all groups (i.e.,nine GTTs performed during the 29 days trial in all participants).\nTaken together, these \ufb01ndings indicate that short-term con-\nsumption of sucralose and saccharin in doses lower than theADI can impact glycemic responses in healthy individuals.\nIn addition to a standardized GTT, we sought to determine\nwhether NNS supplementation also affected daily \ufb02uctuationsin glucose levels as an additional clinically-relevant parameterof glucose homeostasis. The daily coef\ufb01cient of variance (CoV)\nin glucose as derived from the CGM indicated higher variability\nin the saccharin (linear-mixed-effects regression calculated onall days p = 0.0003, Figure S1 A) and stevia (p = 0.005, Figure S1 B)\ngroups, but not in the sucralose ( Figure S1 C) or aspartame ( Fig-\nure S1 D) groups, compared with NSC. However, this was likely\ndue to lower variability in the NSC group (p = 0.07 versus glucose\nvehicle), and none of the NNS groups was signi\ufb01cantly different\nthan the glucose vehicle group ( Figures S1 A\u2013S1D). As both\nsaccharin and sucralose demonstrated a cohort-wide effect on\nglucose tolerance, we asked whether the elevated glycemia\nassociated with their intake is due to NNS effects on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or insulin production. Although partici-pants in the NNS and the glucose vehicle groups were all\nexposed to an equivalent amount of glucose, a signi\ufb01cant in-\ncrease in plasma insulin during exposure was noted in theglucose vehicle group (mean 7.27 mU L\n/C01, 0.14\u201314.4, two-way\nANOVA & Dunnett p = 0.045, Figure S1 E), which remained\nelevated on the last day of the trial (10.27 mU L/C01, 3.4\u201317.1,\np = 0.004, Figure S1 E) and during exposure in the stevia group\n(6.38 mU L/C01, 0.19\u201312.58, p = 0.043, Figure S1 E). However,\nthere were no signi\ufb01cant changes in blood insulin in thesaccharin, sucralose, aspartame, or NSC groups ( Figure S1 E).\nGLP-1 levels were not signi\ufb01cantly altered in any of the groups\n(Figure S1 F). None of the measured anthropometrics (BMI, waist\nand hip circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure,and resting heart rate) or blood markers (blood pressure,\nHbA1c, C-reactive protein, ALT, AST, and blood immune cell\ncounts, see STAR Methods for full list) were signi\ufb01cantlyimpacted (following Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple\nhypothesis testing) by NNS supplementation compared with the\ncontrol groups ( Table S1 ).\nTo determine whether supplementation with sweeteners\naffected participant nutrient intake or physical activity, partici-\npants in the study logged their meals and activities in real time\nthroughout the 4-week trial period. Although all participantsmodestly reduced their energy intake throughout the trial,regardless of the group ( Table S3 ), likely due to the established\neffect of heightened awareness ( Robinson et al., 2015 ), there\nwere no signi\ufb01cant differences in nutrient (carbohydrates, sugar,\ufb01ber, protein, fat, and cholesterol) intake or physical activity\nbetween the groups ( Table S3 ). It is therefore unlikely that the dif-\nferences in glycemic responses stem from differential intake ofcalories or macronutrients or physical activity.\nNon-nutritive sweeteners functionally modulate the\nhuman gut and oral microbiomes\nOne of the mechanisms through which NNS can affect human\nmetabolism may involve alteration of the intestinal microbiome.Evidence for this mechanism stems mostly from animal models,whereas evidence in humans is limited and con\ufb02icted ( Harring-\nton et al., 2022 ). Importantly, as previous studies utilized 16S\nrDNA microbiome pro\ufb01ling, the effect of NNS on species-levelabundance and functional capacity of the microbial community\nremains elusive. We therefore collected longitudinal stool sam-\nples from all participants throughout the baseline, exposure,and follow-up phases and performed shotgun metagenomic\nsequencing (n = 1,182 stool samples after quality \ufb01ltration,\nSTAR Methods ).\nBaseline stool microbiome composition and function were\ncomparable between the NNS (aspartame, sucralose,\nsaccharin, and stevia) and control groups (glucose vehicle,\nNSC, and PERMANOVA p > 0.05, Table S4 ). To determine\nwhether NNS supplementation had an effect on the micro-\nbiome\u2019s temporal dynamics, we performed a trajectory analysis\nusing M-product ( Kilmer et al., 2021 ) based tensor component\nanalysis (TCAM, Mor et al., 2022 ;STAR Methods ) compared\nwith the NSC group. This analysis was performed twice, using\nsamples from individual sampling days as well as weeklyaveraged abundances per participant. A signi\ufb01cant effect on\nthe microbiome composition was observed in the sucralose\n(genus days PERMANOVA, p = 0.002, Figure 3 A; genus weeks,\np = 0.011, Figure S2 A; species days, p = 0.033, Figure S2 B; spe-\ncies weeks, p = 0.012, Figure S2 C) and saccharin (genus days,\np = 0.014, Figure 3 B; species days, p = 0.018, Figure S2 D)\ngroups. All four NNS had a signi\ufb01cant effect on microbiome\nFigure 2.

None of these micro-\nbiome features was signi\ufb01cantly different between the glucosevehicle and the NSC groups ( Figures S2 I\u2013S2O).\nTo determine the microbial features underlying these effects,\nwe plotted the area under the log-fold change curve for the top\nloadings of each signi\ufb01cant comparison. Several top loadingsin the sucralose group were related to purine metabolism ( Fig-\nure 3 G). Top loadings for the saccharin group included pathways\nrelated to glycolysis and glucose degradation ( Figure 3 H). Many\nof the top loadings in the aspartame group were related to poly-\namines metabolism ( Figure 3 I). Several top loadings in the stevia\ngroup were related to fatty acid biosynthesis ( Figure 3 J). Collec-\ntively, these results suggest that dietary supplementation withNNS can impact the functional potential of the human micro-\nbiome in NNS-speci\ufb01c manners, with the most prominent effects\non the fecal microbiome observed with sucralose.\nSimilarly, NNS distinctly impacted the oral microbiome (eight\nsamples per participant throughout the trial, STAR Methods ).\nThe relative abundance of four metabolism-related KEGG path-ways ( Figures S3 A\u2013S3D) and three modules ( Table S5 )\ndecreased during the 2nd week of exposure in the oral micro-\nbiome of the stevia group. Notable oral microbiome alterations(p < 0.1) in the other NNS groups include changes in relative\nabundances of six Streptococcus species in the sucralose group\n(Figure S3 E;Table S6 ), reduced relative abundance of Fusobac-\nterium in the saccharin group ( Figure S3 F;Table S5 ), and\nreduced abundance of Porphyromonas (Figure S3 G) and Prevo-\ntella nanceiensis (Figure S3 H) in the aspartame group ( Table S5 ).\nThere were no oral microbiome alterations with an FDR-cor-rected p < 0.1 in either control group ( Table S6 ), and baseline\noral microbiome composition and function were comparable be-\ntween the NNS and control groups (PERMANOVA p > 0.05,Table S4 ).\nMicrobiome features correlate with NNS impacts on the\nhuman glycemic response\nWe next sought to identify microbiome features that potentially\ncontribute to the NNS effects noted on glycemic control and un-cover putative host targets that may link these NNS-related func-tional microbiome alterations to an effect on the host. We initiallyfocused on sucralose as this NNS is poorly absorbed and is more\nlikely to interact with the intestinal microbiome. Furthermore, of\nthe two NNS that signi\ufb01cantly impacted glucose tolerance, the\nsucralose group displayed greater person-to-person heteroge-neity, providing an opportunity to elucidate microbiome and me-\ntabolome contributions to personalized glycemic responses.\nFirst, we correlated the baseline abundance of stool bacterialgenera and species, KEGG modules and pathways, andMetaCyc pathways with the GTT-iAUC measured during the\n2nd week of sucralose exposure. We then assessed how the\nsigni\ufb01cantly correlated features (Pearson p < 0.05) changedthroughout the trial ( Table S6\n). Signi\ufb01cant metagenomic results\nincluded those strictly appearing in the sucralose group (n =\n20), although not being altered in the glucose (n = 20) and NSC(n = 20) control groups. The plasma metabolome for sucralose\nconsumers was pro\ufb01led at baseline (day 0) and after the 1st\nweek of NNS supplementation (day 14). Signi\ufb01cant metabolomicresults included those strictly appearing in the sucralose group(n = 20), although not being altered in the glucose (n = 10) and\nNSC (n = 10) control groups ( Table S6 ).\nBaseline abundance of three bacterial species correlated with\nGTT-iAUC ( Figure 4 A). Functionally, the abundances of several\npurine biosynthesis pathways were positively associated with\nGTT-iAUC and gradually decreased during the trial. Mixed acidfermentation and the TCA cycle were also inversely correlated\nwith GTT-iAUC; the abundances of these pathways increased\nduring both exposure weeks and trended toward baseline duringfollow-up ( Figure 4 A). Nine metabolites signi\ufb01cantly increased in\nplasma during sucralose supplementation and three decreased\n(FDR-corrected paired t test p < 0.05, Figures 4 B\u20134D). No signif-\nicant changes were noted following FDR correction in plasmametabolites in the glucose vehicle and NSC groups ( Table S6 ).\nIn line with the increased abundance of the TCA cycle pathway\nin the microbiome, the levels of iso-citrate and trans-aconitate,TCA cycle intermediates, increased in plasma during sucralose\nsupplementation ( Figure 4 B). Levels of the amino acids serine,\nN-acetyl alanine, and aspartate, as well as the aspartate me-\ntabolite quinolinate, also increased during supplementation\n(Figure 4 B). Two additional TCA cycle metabolites (citrate and\nfumarate) and several additional amino acids (cystine, lysine,and glycyl-L-valine) signi\ufb01cantly increased during supplementa-tion (before FDR correction, Table S6 ). In line with the reduction\nof microbial pathways related to purine metabolism, plasma\nlevels of pseudouridine and uric acid were signi\ufb01cantly reducedduring sucralose supplementation ( Figure 4 D), as well as\nFigure 3.

To identify metabolites that may mediate responsive-\nness to sucralose and those that are potentially involved in su-\ncralose effect on glucose tolerance, we next compared themetabolomic pro\ufb01les of the top and bottom \ufb01ve sucralose re-\nsponders. Three metabolites were signi\ufb01cantly different be-\ntween top and bottom responders (FDR-corrected two-wayANOVA p < 0.05, Figure 4 F): the ketone body beta-hydroxybuty-\nrate, serine, and the cysteine derivate cysteate. All three were\nlowest in top sucralose responders at baseline and increased\nduring supplementation. None of these metabolites was signi\ufb01-cantly different between the \ufb01ve top and bottom responders in\nthe glucose and NSC control groups ( Table S6 ).\nWe similarly correlated the abundances of baseline metage-\nnomic features with GTT-iAUC in the saccharin, stevia, and\naspartame groups, as well as metabolomic pro\ufb01les in the top 5\nresponders in each group. Signi\ufb01cant metagenomic resultsincluded those strictly appearing in any of the saccharin, aspar-tame or stevia groups, although not being altered in the glucose\nand NSC control groups. The plasma metabolome for sucralose\nconsumers was pro\ufb01led at baseline (day 0) , after the 1st week ofNNS supplementation (day 14) and at end of the follow-up (day\n28). Signi\ufb01cant metabolomic results included those strictly ap-\npearing in the any of the saccharin, aspartame, or stevia groups,although not being altered in the respective glucose and NSC\ncontrol groups. In the saccharin group, baseline levels of Prevo-\ntella copri and UMP biosynthesis were positively associated with\nGTT-iAUC and gradually increased during exposure, whereas\nbaseline levels of Bacteroides xylanisolvens were negatively\nassociated with GTT-iAUC and increased during exposure ( Fig-\nure 5 A). Many of the pathways negatively correlated with GTT-\niAUC were related to glycolysis and glycan degradation ( Fig-\nure 5 A). Untargeted plasma metabolomics of the top \ufb01ve\nsaccharin responders readily detected high levels of saccharinduring exposure ( Figure 5 B). The plasma levels of indoxyl sulfate,\na metabolite associated with vascular disease, increased during\nsaccharin exposure ( Figure 5 B). Levels of the SCFA butyrate\nincreased during the trial, whereas those of three long-chain fatty\nacids were reduced ( Figure 5 B;Table S5 ). In the stevia group,\ntwo Prevotella spp. were positively associated with GTT-iAUC,\nand reduced during exposure; Bacteroides coprophilus ,Para-\nbacteroides goldsteinii , and a Lachnospira spp., which were\nalso positively associated with GTT-iAUC increased during\nboth exposure weeks ( Figure 5 C). Stevioside was readily de-\ntected in plasma samples of the stevia group, exclusively during\nsupplementation ( Figure 5 D). Levels of the amino acids serine\nand lysine increased during stevia supplementation ( Figure 5 D).\nNotably, two metabolites of arginine, ornithine and citrulline, also\nincreased during exposure ( Figure 5 D). In the aspartame group,\nB. fragilis and B. acidifaciens were positively associated with\nGTT-iAUC, whereas B. coprocola had an inverse correlation(Figure 5 E). Levels of kynurenine, a metabolite associated with\ndiabetes, increased during aspartame consumption ( Figure 5 F).\nCollectively, human NNS supplementation induced distinct al-\nterations in microbiome composition and function, as well as indistinct plasma metabolites, in each of the NNS-supplemented\ngroups, which correlated with host glycemic responses.\nNotably, changes in abundance of many of the correlated micro-biome or metabolome features start as early as the 1st week ofexposure and revert to baseline during follow-up, suggesting\nthat these bacterial species and functions may respond to the\npresence of NNS.\nCausative personalized impacts of NNS-modulated\nmicrobiome on glycemic responsesTo determine whether the aforementioned alterations in human\nmicrobiome con\ufb01guration causally contribute to NNS-induced\nhyperglycemia, we colonized adult GF mice with stool micro-\nbiome collected either at the beginning of the trial (day 1), or\non the last day of exposure (day 21), from all four NNS-supple-\nmented and control groups ( Figure S4 A). In total, we trans-\nplanted microbiomes from 42 individuals, the four individuals ineach group that had the most potent response (\u2018\u2018top re-\nsponders\u2019\u2019), and the three that had the lowest response (\u2018\u2018bottom\nresponders\u2019\u2019) in their respective groups. Statistically, each indi-vidual donor was strictly treated as a random effect in the\nLMM while modeling the glycemic response variable. Strikingly,\nfor each of the four \u2018\u2018top responders\u2019\u2019 in the saccharin and sucra-lose groups, mice humanized with the day 21 sample had a\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher glycemic response compared with mice\nthat received the baseline sample from the same individual(saccharin top 1-t test p = 0.0072, top 2 p = 0.025, top 3 p =0.0046, top 4 p = 0.048, Figure S4 ; sucralose top 1 p = 0.025,\ntop 2 p = 0.016, top 3 p = 0.043, top 4 p = 0.0031, Figure S5 ), re-\nsulting in a signi\ufb01cant group effect for both saccharin ( Figure 6 A,\nmixed-effects ANOVA p < 0.0001) and sucralose ( Figure 6 B,\np < 0.0001). Microbiomes transferred from the last day of expo-\nsure of the four \u2018\u2018top responders\u2019\u2019 to stevia and aspartame re-sulted in elevated glycemic response in recipient mice of three\nout of the four top-responding donors (stevia p < 0.0001,\np < 0.0001, p = 0.029; aspartame p = 0.012, 0.048, and 0.015,Figure S6 ), resulting in a signi\ufb01cant group effect for both (stevia\np < 0.0001, Figure 6 C; aspartame p = 0.0022, Figure 6 D). Impor-\ntantly, none of the day 21 stool microbiome samples transferredinto GF mice from the four \u2018\u2018top responders\u2019\u2019 in the glucosevehicle or the NSC groups ( Figures 6 E and 6F; Figure S7 ) re-\nsulted in a signi\ufb01cant effect on glucose tolerance, compared\nwith baseline microbiome samples transferred from the same in-dividuals. To further elucidate the extent of the causative person-\nalized NNS-mediated effect size, we transplanted baseline and\nday 21 microbiomes from the bottom three responders in eachgroup into GF mice.

Collectively, the gly-\ncemic responses in the humanized mice largely re\ufb02ected thoseof their NNS-supplemented donors and serve as a likely causal\nlink between NNS-related microbiome modulations and disrup-\nted glycemic control.\nMicrobiome features correlate with person-speci\ufb01c\nvariations in glycemic responses to NNSFinally, we compared fecal microbiome features potentially\ndifferentiating human top NNS responders (n = 4 in each NNS)\nand bottom responders (n = 3 in each NNS). In human partici-pants, KEGG pathways Bray-Curtis-based dissimilarity to base-line con\ufb01gurations trended to be higher in top responders\nthroughout the trial in the sucralose ( Figure S8 A), stevia ( Fig-\nure S8 B), and aspartame ( Figure S8 C) groups and were initially\nhigher in bottom responders but converged in the saccharin\ngroup ( Figure S8 D). Importantly, top and bottom \u2018\u2018responders\u2019\u2019\nwere comparable in the glucose vehicle and NSC groups(Figures S8 E and S8F). The fold change between baseline and\nthe 2nd week of exposure of pathways related to glycolysis\nand TCA cycle was higher in sucralose top responderscompared with bottom responders ( Figure S8 G). Pathways\nrelated to biosynthesis, degradation and metabolism of purines\nand pyrimidines increased in top stevia responders ( Figure S8 H).\nPathways related to the urea cycle and its metabolites increasedin top aspartame responders, whereas Akkermansia muciniphila ,\nassociated with metabolic health of the host ( Cani et al., 2022 ),\nincreased in bottom responders ( Figure S8 I). Degradation of\nthe cyclic amide caprolactam increased in saccharin top re-sponders, suggesting a possible potential for degradation of\nchemically related saccharin. Biosynthesis of the branched-\nchain amino acid isoleucine, associated with poorer metabolic\nhealth ( Yu et al., 2021 ), also increased in top saccharin re-\nsponders ( Figure S8 J).\nTo further exemplify such personalized microbiome differ-\nences, we compared the fecal microbiome con\ufb01gurations of GFmouse groups transplanted with microbiomes of top (n = 3) andbottom (n = 3) human sucralose responders (n = 3, Figure 7 A),\nin which each of the top human donors and none of the bottom\ndonors exhibited a signi\ufb01cant difference in glycemic responsebetween baseline and day 21 of the clinical trial ( Figure S5 ). GF\nmouse recipients of microbiomes from top sucralose human\nresponders on day 21 featured a distinct microbiome con\ufb01gura-tion compared with GF mouse recipients of microbiome from\nbottom sucralose human responders on day 21 (Rcpt: D21,\nPERMANOVA with donor as random effect PC3 p = 0.008, Fig-\nure 7 B), in line with the differential glycemic responses noted in\nthe human donors at day 21 time point ( Figure S5 ). Total 22 spe-\ncies and 19 pathways were differentially abundant between\nmouse recipients of microbiomes from top and bottom humansucralose responders on day 21, of which only two were also\ndifferent at baseline (pyrimidine biosynthesis and tRNA charging,\nTable S7 ). The putrescine biosynthetic pathway was overrepre-\nsented in mice conventionalized with top responders\u2019 day 21\nsamples (p < 0.0001); elevated plasma levels of putrescine\nwere previously associated with type-2 diabetes ( Fernandez-\nGarcia et al., 2019 ) and gestational diabetes ( Liu et al., 2021 ).\nNotably, transplantation of baseline microbiomes of top and\nbottom sucralose responders into GF mice resulted in compara-ble glucose tolerance in recipient mice (Rcpt: BL, Figure 7 C).\nNonetheless, microbiome con\ufb01gurations of mice receiving base-\nline pre-exposure microbiomes from human top sucralose\nresponders were already signi\ufb01cantly different from those of re-cipients of baseline microbiomes from human bottom sucralose\nresponders. Microbiome composition of mouse recipients of\nbaseline samples of top and bottom human responders wassigni\ufb01cantly separated on PC3 (PERMANOVA with donor as\nFigure 6.

The microbial features that poten-\ntially mediate these differences included 25 species and 27 path-\nways that are signi\ufb01cantly (FDR-corrected linear-mixed modelp < 0.05) differentially abundant between the two subsets\n(Table S7 ). Pathways related to menaquinol biosynthesis, previ-\nously associated with type 1 ( Roth-Schulze et al., 2021 ) and type\n2 diabetes ( Balvers et al., 2021 ;Dash and Bataineh, 2021 ;Wu\net al., 2020 ), were the most overrepresented features in mouse\nrecipients of baseline microbiomes from top responders (p =\n0.0006, Figure 7 F). Pathways related to purine (p < 0.0001) and\npyrimidine (p = 0.005) biosynthesis were more abundant in\nmouse recipients of baseline microbiomes of top responders,\nwhereas purine degradation (p < 0.0001) was more abundantin recipients of baseline microbiomes from bottom responders\n(Figure 7 F), in line with the correlation between purine biosyn-\nthesis and elevated glycemic response noted in the entire sucra-lose group ( Figure 4 A). Most pathways over-abundant in mouse\nrecipients of baseline microbiomes from bottom responders\nwere related to fatty acid biosynthesis (stearate biosynthesis\np = 0.014, dodecanoate biosynthesis p < 0.0001, saturated fattyacid elongation p = 0.005, and phosphatidylglycerol biosyn-\nthesis p = 0.003) and their utilization for energy production and\ngluconeogenesis (glyoxylate bypass and TCA p < 0.0001) ( Fig-\nure 7 F). To identify microbial pathways that may predict the\neffect of sucralose on glucose tolerance, we correlated the base-\nline abundance of each pathway with the fold difference in theGTT AUC of recipient mice (day 21/baseline). Interestingly, the\nbaseline abundance of the glycolysis pathway demonstrated a\nsigni\ufb01cant (FDR-corrected) and strong correlation with GTT-AUC (Spearman r = 1, p = 0.0028, Figure 7 G;Table S7 ). Collec-\ntively, these results suggest that a unique pre-supplementation\nbaseline microbiome con\ufb01guration may contribute to the\npersonalized responses noted upon subsequent exposure tosucralose.\nTo further identify microbiome functions potentially linked to\nalterations in glucose tolerance in recipient mice of top and bot-tom sucralose-responder human microbiomes, we compared\nmicrobiome pro\ufb01les of mouse recipients of top and bottom hu-\nman sucralose responders collected on day 21 with those in\nmice receiving baseline pre-exposure samples from the sametop and bottom sucralose-responsive humans. Indeed, mice\nreceiving day 21 microbiome samples from top responders pre-\nsented higher alpha diversity compared with those receivingbaseline microbiomes from the same top responders orcompared with mice receiving day 21 microbiomes from bottom\nresponders (linear-mixed effects regression, p = 0.004; Fig-\nure 7 H). A comparison between the baseline and day 21 mouse\nrecipient microbiomes revealed 13 pathways signi\ufb01cantly\naltered in the top responders\u2019 group and none in the bottom\nresponder mice. All signi\ufb01cantly altered pathways were lessabundant on day 21 compared with baseline ( Figure 7 I;\nTable S7 ). Pathways related to the biosynthesis of fatty acids,\nalready less abundant in mouse recipients of baseline topresponder microbiomes compared with mouse recipients ofbaseline bottom responder microbiomes, became undetectable\nin mice transplanted with day 21 top responder microbiome (p =\n0.012). The fold increase of two pathways (day 21/baselineabundance) was signi\ufb01cantly correlated with an increased glyce-\nmic response: sucrose degradation (Spearman r = /C01, p =\n0.0028, Figure 7 J) and glycogen degradation (Spearman r = 1,\np = 0.0028, Figure 7 K). Taken together, these results suggest\nthat the ability of the microbiome to respond to sucralose in\naltering host glucose tolerance may be mediated, at least inpart, by the capacity of the bacteria to metabolize dietary and/\nor host-derived carbohydrates and utilize them for energy pro-\nduction. These results merit future causative validation in futurestudies.\nDISCUSSION\nOur work provides evidence of human microbiome responsive-\nness to NNS and its ability to transmit, in speci\ufb01c con\ufb01gurations,\ndownstream effects on the host glucose tolerance.

Similarly, other \u2018\u2018modern\u2019\u2019 food additives such as di-\netary emulsi\ufb01ers ( Chassaing et al., 2015 ;Tang et al., 2013 ), food\npreservatives ( Tirosh et al., 2019 ), and colorants ( He et al., 2021 )\nhave been suggested to impact the microbiome and, in somecases, mediate downstream host metabolic effects. Interest-\ningly, although the small amount of vehicle glucose incorporated\ninto the NNS sachets and consumed by all participants inthe NNS groups was comparable to the amount of glucose\nconsumed by participants in the vehicle group, plasma insulin\nlevels rose during supplementation only in the stevia and glucosevehicle groups. These results suggest a possible blunting of\nglucose-stimulated insulin secretion, leading to elevated glyce-\nmia in participants consuming saccharin or sucralose (withglucose as a vehicle). Notably, coupling of NNS with a caloricsweetener was reported to result in a higher insulin response\ncompared with NNS alone ( Dalenberg et al., 2020 ). The putative\nimpacts of NNS on insulin sensitivity with and without a carbohy-drate moiety should be addressed in further studies under\nglucose challenge conditions.\nNotably, all four tested NNS (saccharin, sucralose, aspartame,\nand stevia) signi\ufb01cantly and distinctly altered the human intesti-\nnal and oral microbiome, as would be expected for these chem-\nically diverse compounds. Such an effect was not observed inthe two control groups. Sucralose ( Olivier-Van Stichelen et al.,\n2019 ;Uebanso et al., 2017 ), saccharin ( Serrano et al., 2021 ),\nand stevia metabolites ( Wheeler et al., 2008 ) are found in stool\nof NNS-supplemented animals and humans, suggesting thatdirect interaction of these NNS with the intestinal microbiome\nis fully plausible. Sucralose is poorly absorbed, and thus, the ma-\njority of orally supplemented sucralose reaches the colon, andsubsequently, most, but not all, is excreted unchanged in feces\n(John et al., 2000 ;Roberts et al., 2000 ;Sims et al., 2000 ;Wood\net al., 2000 ). The metabolic fate of the remaining fraction is\ncurrently unknown, although sucralose-related metabolites of\nunknown function have been identi\ufb01ed in feces and adipose tis-\nsue ( Bornemann et al., 2018 ). Interestingly, inter-subject vari-\nability in fecal excretion was reported ( Roberts et al., 2000 ;\nSims et al., 2000 ;Sylvetsky et al., 2017c ;Wood et al., 2000 ),\npotentially underlying heterogeneity in metabolic responses to\nsucralose. Saccharin is slowly absorbed from the gut to thebloodstream, and a minority of ingested saccharin (5%\u201315%)\nis excreted in feces, mostly unchanged ( Ball et al., 1974 ;Ren-\nwick, 1985 ;Sweatman et al., 1981 ). The long absorption time\nand poor bioavailability support possible interactions with the\nmicrobiome. Degradation of steviol glycosides by gut bacteria\nis an established component of their metabolism ( Magnuson\net al., 2016 ), although some species may be more pro\ufb01cient\nthan others in performing this task ( Gardana et al., 2003 ), and\nthus, pre-exposure microbiome heterogeneity may conduce todifferential responses to stevia. In contrast to sucralose,saccharin, and stevia, aspartame is metabolized by host en-\nzymes in the proximal regions of the gastrointestinal tract ( Mag-\nnuson et al., 2016 ). Thus, the mechanisms through which\naspartame modulated the fecal microbiome of human partici-pants in this study and in previous reports in animal models ( Net-\ntleton et al., 2020 ;Palmna \u00a8s et al., 2014 ) merit further study.\nNNS may impact gut commensals through several direct and\nindirect mechanisms, some highlighted by our study\u2019s results.\nFirst, NNS may induce microbial growth inhibition, as was shown\nfor cultured E. coli (Harpaz et al., 2018 ;Wang et al., 2018 ), path-\nogens ( Su\u00a8nderhauf et al., 2020 ), oral ( Prashant et al., 2012 ), and\nenvironmental ( Omran et al., 2013 ) bacteria, or of commensals of\nthe rat cecal content ( Naim et al., 1985 ) and human stool ( Va-\nmanu et al., 2019 ).In vivo studies similarly demonstrated a\nreduction in total fecal bacterial loads in animals treated with su-cralose ( Abou-Donia et al., 2008 ) or saccharin ( Su\u00a8nderhauf et al.,\n2020 ). The bacterial targets affected by NNS are not fully identi-\n\ufb01ed and potentially include disruption of quorum sensing ( Bian\net al., 2017c ;Markus et al., 2021 ), triggering of SOS responses\n(Yu et al., 2021 ), increased membrane permeability ( Yu et al.,\n2021 ), increased mutation frequency ( Qu et al., 2017 ), inhibition\nof glucose/sucrose transport to the bacterial cell ( Omran et al.,\n2013 ;Pfeffer et al., 1985 ), inhibition of sucrose enzymatic degra-\ndation or glucose fermentation ( Omran et al., 2013 ;Pfeffer et al.,\n1985 ), and a reduction in the abundance of phosphotransferase\nsystem (PTS) genes involved in the transport of sugars to the\nbacterial cell, in microbiome cultures and in mice exposed to\nsaccharin ( Suez et al., 2014 ). In the current study, sucralose\nexposure resulted in reduced abundance of nucleotide biosyn-\nthesis genes, which might be linked to inhibited bacterial replica-\ntion. In contrast, the abundance of genes related to mixed-acidfermentation and TCA cycle increased during sucralose supple-\nmentation. TCA metabolites were also elevated in plasma during\nsucralose supplementation, suggestive of possible microbiomecontributions. Elevated plasma levels of TCA metabolites hasbeen associated with impaired glycemic control ( Fiehn et al.,\n2010 ;Guasch-Ferre \u00b4et al., 2020 ).\nIn addition, some bacterial species may bloom in the presence\nof NNS ( Palmna \u00a8se ta l . ,2 0 1 4 ;Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2018 ).\nBlooming may be mediated by an unoccupied niche, depleted\nof species inhibited by NNS. Alternatively, some gut bacteriacan utilize NNS that reach the lower gut (e.g., saccharin and su-\ncralose) as an energy or carbon source, thus gaining a growth\nadvantage in their presence ( Schiffman and Rother, 2013 ). Such\nmechanism was mainly studied to date in environmental bacteria(Labare and Alexander, 1995 ) or shown to exist in a single species\nin the presence of oxygen ( Schleheck and Cook, 2003 ). One hint\nfor such a mechanism in our study relates to the detection ofseveral metabolites in the plasma of saccharin-supplemented in-\ndividuals that may stem from saccharin degradation. Exploring\nsuch degradation capacities merits future studies in gut-residing\nhuman commensals. Notably, NNS could potentially alter the mi-\ncrobiome through indirect, host-mediated effects. These include\ninteraction between NNS and sweet and/or bitter taste receptorsin the gut and downstream effects on the microbiome ( Turner\net al., 2020 ) and possible effects of NNS on the immune system\n(Bian et al., 2017a ,2017c ;Cheng et al., 2021 ;Mart\u0131 \u00b4nez-Carrillo\net al., 2019 ). These merit further study.\nCollectively, our study suggests that commonly consumed\nNNS may not be physiologically inert in humans as previously\ncontemplated, with some of their effects mediated indirectlythrough impacts exerted on distinct con\ufb01gurations of the humanll\n3322 Cell 185, 3307\u20133328, September 1, 2022Articlemicrobiome. We stress that these results should not be inter-\npreted as calling for consumption of sugar, which is strongly\nlinked to cardiometabolic diseases and other adverse health ef-\nfects ( Malik and Hu, 2022; Vos et al., 2017 ). Unraveling molecular\nmechanisms and clinical consequences of NNS consumption on\nthe human host and microbiome may enable to optimize dietary\nrecommendations in preventing and treating hyperglycemia andits metabolic rami\ufb01cations.\nLimitations of the study\nLimitations of our study include the inclusion of healthy, non-overweight, normoglycemic individuals, as NNS effects may\ndiffer between healthy and individuals with cardiometabolic dis-\neases ( Nichol et al., 2019 ), calling for further studies in these pop-\nulations. In addition, the NNS in our study were administered ascommercially available sachets containing a mixture of glucose\nand a given NNS. Microbiome and glycemic responses may\ndiffer when administered as commercial NNS sachets (contain-ing carbohydrates as \ufb01llers) ( Romo-Romo et al., 2018 ;Suez\net al., 2014 ) in comparison with their puri\ufb01ed forms ( Ahmad\net al., 2020a ,2020b ;Kim et al., 2020 ;Serrano et al., 2021 ;Thom-\nson et al., 2019 ). Indeed, Dalenberg et al. elegantly reported an\nadverse effect of short-term supplementation with sucralose\non glycemic control, only when the NNS was coupled with a car-bohydrate ( Dalenberg et al., 2020 ). In line with this observation,\nwe found that a combination of bulking glucose with saccharin\nor sucralose, but not glucose alone, resulted in an impaired gly-\ncemic response, whereas elevated plasma insulin was onlyobserved in individuals supplemented with glucose alone or ste-\nvia. Notably, plasma insulin was not measured under fasting\nconditions, limiting the interpretation of these results. However,if such formulation distinction is true, NNS impacts should be\ncompared in future controlled trials between consumers of car-\nbohydrate-rich and carbohydrate-restrictive diets for their po-tential differential effects on human metabolic physiology. Of\nnote, longer exposure periods (4\u201310 weeks) to pure NNS were\nsuggested by some studies to negatively impact metabolichealth even in the absence of a carbohydrate additive ( Bueno-\nHerna \u00b4ndez et al., 2020 ;Higgins and Mattes, 2019 ;Lertrit et al.,\n2018 ;Me\u00b4ndez-Garc\u0131 \u00b4a et al., 2022 ). As such, a longer exposure\nperiod than the one utilized in our study may be required to fullyassess the potential health rami\ufb01cations mediated by the altered\nmicrobiome upon consumption of different NNS. Likewise, the\nNNS doses tested in our study were 240 mg (aspartame, /C248%\nADI), 180 mg (saccharin, /C2420% ADI), 102 mg (sucralose, 34%\nADI), and 180 mg (stevia, /C2475% ADI). Future studies may deter-\nmine whether even lower doses may differentially impact the mi-crobiome and host glycemic responses.\nSTAR+METHODS\nDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper\nand include the following:\ndKEY RESOURCES TABLE\ndRESOURCE AVAILABILITY\nBLead contact\nBMaterials availabilityBData and code availability\ndEXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS\nBHuman subjects\nBAnimals\ndMETHOD DETAILS\nBHuman trial experimental procedures\nBNon-nutritive sweeteners supplementation in humans\nBGlucose tolerance tests in humans\nBCGM Coef\ufb01cient of variance (CoV) analysis\nBAdverse events\nBDiet and activity logs analysis\nBGlucose tolerance tests in conventionalized germ-\nfree mice\nBShotgun metagenomic sequencing\nBMetagenomic analysis of stool and oral microbiomesamples\nBUntargeted metabolomics\ndQUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nBData integrity check\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nSupplemental information can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.\n2022.07.016 .\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the members of the Elinav lab, Weizmann Institute of Science, and\nmembers of the DKFZ microbiome and cancer division for insightful discus-\nsions; Carmit Bar-Nathan for dedicated germ-free mouse husbandry; HadarAriely, Gili Weinberg, and Dana Regev-Lehavi for coordinating the clinical trial.J.S. is the recipient of the Strauss Institute research fellowship.

We excluded participants who consumed any quantity of NNS-containing foods or beverages in the six months prior to the\ntrial initiation using an online custom-made food frequency questionnaire, further validated over the phone by a Clinical ResearchAssociate (CRA). Participants were required to provide their consumption frequency (never; once a month; more than once a month;\nonce a week; more than once a week; once a day; more than once a day) for each of the following NNS-containing products on the\nIsraeli market: carbonated diet drinks; sugar-free energy drinks; non-carbonated diet drinks (diet iced tea, diet fruit juices, dietsyrups); diet yogurt; sugar-free chewing gum; protein powders/gainers; sugar-free ice-cream; diet/low/sugar-free cookies, cakes,pastry; low/sugar-free jam, marmalade; sachets/tablets/drops of non-nutritive sweeteners; low/sugar-free ketchup or other sauces;\nsugar-free halva; diet bread / pita bread; diet syrups (chocolate, maple .); sugar-free chocolate; low/sugar-free cereals; any product\nlabeled as \u2018\u2018diet / low / sugar-free\u2019\u2019. Additional exclusion criteria included: (i) pregnancy or fertility treatments; (ii) breastfeeding(including baby to breast and bottle feeding mother\u2019s expressed breast milk); (iii) usage of antibiotics or antifungals within three\nmonths prior to participation; (iv) BMI < 18 or > 28; (v) pre-diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or treatment with anti-diabetic\nmedication; (vi) chronically active in\ufb02ammatory or neoplastic disease in the three years prior to enrollment; (vii) chronic gastrointes-tinal disorder, including in\ufb02ammatory bowel disease and celiac disease; (viii) active neuropsychiatric disorder; (ix) myocardial infarc-\ntion or cerebrovascular accident in the six months prior to participation; (x) coagulation disorders; (xi) chronic immunosuppressive\nmedication usage; (xii) alcohol or substance abuse; (xiii) bariatric surgery; (xiv) phenylketonuria excluded randomization to the aspar-tame group. Screening for individuals meeting the aforementioned criteria was achieved using an online questionnaire, validated overthe phone by a CRA or a medical doctor. The most frequent exclusion criterion was NNS consumption ( Figure 1 B).\nParticipants\nBetween 2018-2020, a total of 131 eligible participants were invited in groups of 4-12 to an initiation meeting at the WeizmannInstitute of Science, during which they received full details regarding the study aims, protocol, and risks. After the meeting, all 131\nindividuals consented to participate, \ufb01lled an informed consent form, and were randomized to six intervention arms: aspartame, su-\ncralose, saccharin, stevia, glucose vehicle, or no supplement control (see the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials(CONSORT) \ufb02ow diagram in Figure 1 B). Seven participants decided to prematurely terminate their participation for the following rea-\nsons ( Figure 1 B): positive result in a pregnancy test conducted during the baseline week (N=1, saccharin); dislike for the taste of the\nNNS (N=1, sucralose); nausea after performing GTTs (N=1, NSC); pain and minor bleeding during sensor insertion (N=1, stevia);dif\ufb01culty with adherence to the study protocol (N=3, two in the glucose vehicle group and one in the NSC group). All participants\nwithdrew prior to day 14, thus an intention-to-treat analysis was not feasible. Four additional participants were excluded from the\nanalysis after the trial was completed due to insuf\ufb01cient data for the primary outcome, as follows: mishandling of the CGM resultingin no recorded glucose events (N=1, stevia); less than four valid recorded GTTs (out of nine, see GTT exclusion criteria below, N=3,one each in the stevia, glucose, and NSC groups).\nCohort details\nA total of 120 participants were included in the analysis, of which 65% were female, median age 29.95 (IQR 26.93-35.23). No baselinedifferences were found between the groups in the following parameters ( Table S1 ): Weight, BMI, waist-hip ratio, %HbA1c, CRP, total\ncholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, ALT, AST (Kruskal-Wallis); dietary habits,\nsmoking (Chi-square).\nAnimals\nGerm-free mice were used to causally link between microbiome of NNS-consuming humans and glucose tolerance. All mice were\nSwiss-Webster WT adult (seven- to nine-week-old) males and served as recipients for fecal microbiome transplants from human do-nors. All animal studies were approved by the Weizmann Institute of Science Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee\n(IACUC), application number 13250419-3.\nMETHOD DETAILS\nHuman trial experimental procedures\nDuring an introductory meeting at the Weizmann Institute, consenting individuals were connected to a continuous glucose monitor\n(CGM; FreeStyle Libre, Abbott) and anthropometric, blood pressure and heart-rate measurements were taken by a Clinical Research\nAssociate (CRA) or a certi\ufb01ed nurse, as well as a non-fasting blood test used for the blood works detailed in Table S1 , as well as for\ninsulin and GLP-1 using commercial ELISA kits (Crystal Chem). This was considered as day 0 ( Figure 1 ). Participants arrived for two\nadditional identical sessions on days 14 and 28, which was the last day of the trial. The CGM was replaced on day 14 according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. Participants were provided with a kit to sample their microbiome and perform glucose tolerance tests athome on pre-determined days. On days 8-21, participants in all groups except NSC consumed six commercially available sachets ofNNS (with glucose as a vehicle bulking agent) or the equivalent amount of glucose daily, dissolved in water. NNS and glucose were\nprovided by the researchers during the introductory meeting. Throughout the 28 days of the trial, participants were instructed to re-\ncord all daily activities, including standardized and real-life meals, in real-time using their smartphones; meals were recorded withexact components and weights. For oral microbiome pro\ufb01ling, participants serially swabbed their buccal cavity in the morning onll\ne2 Cell 185, 3307\u20133328.e1\u2013e5, September 1, 2022Articlepre-determined days during the trial (eight samples per participant), following tooth brushing, but before consumption of food or us-\nage of mouthwash.\nNon-nutritive sweeteners supplementation in humans\nParticipants were supplied with sachets of commercial formulations of NNS used for sweetening hot beverages, all containing\nglucose as a bulking agent. Common, commercially available sachets were chosen in order to resemble real-life intake and maximize\nadherence to the protocol and acceptability of the supplement. The distinct \ufb02avor of NNS and glucose rendered blinding unfeasible.Participants consumed six sachets a day during the exposure period, resulting in the following daily doses: aspartame 0.24g & 5.76gglucose, saccharin 0.18g & 5.82g glucose, sucralose 0.102g & 5.898g glucose, stevia (steviol glycosides) 0.18g & 5.82g glucose.\nThese doses are below the acceptable daily intakes, correspondingly: 50mg/kg, 15mg/kg, 5mg/kg, 4mg/kg. The glucose vehicle\ngroup was supplemented with 5g of glucose daily. All groups received the same number of sachets per day to allow comparisonto the glucose vehicle group. Participants were instructed to consume two sachets of NNS dissolved in water three times during\nthe day: morning, afternoon, and evening. Drinking of NNS was allowed either with or without meals. Participants recorded intake\nin real-time using a dedicated smartphone app. A CRA reviewed the logs daily to guarantee adherence to the protocol.\nGlucose tolerance tests in humans\nParticipants were provided with 50 g of glucose (Floris) to perform GTT at home, with the following instructions: (A) at least seven andno more than fourteen hours without any food, supplements, physical activity or any drink other than water prior to GTT initiation;(B) the entire amount of glucose should be dissolved in a cup of water without any supplements and consumed in less than two mi-\nnutes; (C) no physical activity, food or drinks other than water allowed during two hours after initiation; (D) GTT initiation should be\nrecorded on the smartphone app, and data from the glucose sensor should be downloaded frequently to the reader. Participantsreceived text message reminders on the days of the GTT. Out of 1080 expected GTTs, 5.5% (n=60) were not performed (n=23) or\nperformed but data were not recorded (n=37). Sensor malfunctions resulted in the loss of 1% of GTTs (n=11). In addition, 2.6% of\nGTTs (n=28) were excluded from the analysis for not meeting the aforementioned requirements, as follows: food consumed duringGTT (n=14), physical activity performed during GTT (n=5), fasting exceeds \ufb01fteen hours (n=4), consumption of glucose took >10 mi-\nnutes (n=3), participant took a glucose-lowering medication (n=2). There were no signi\ufb01cant differences (Chi-square) in the number of\nmissing/excluded GTTs between phases (P=0.86) or treatment groups (P=0.61).\nCGM Coef\ufb01cient of variance (CoV) analysis\nDaily CoV was evaluated for each participant by dividing the daily standard deviation, considering all glucose measurements of theday, by the daily average. The signi\ufb01cance of the trajectory changes in CoV was tested using LMER with participants as random ef-fect and testing for the interaction between time and groups.\nAdverse events\nFew minor adverse events were reported (n=5), all during the baseline week prior to supplementation with NNS: diarrhea after \ufb01rst\nGTT (n=2, one in the aspartame group and the other in the NSC group); common cold-like symptoms for several days without need for\nmedical care (n=2, sucralose and saccharin); mild transient pain in the CGM insertion site (n=1, aspartame).\nDiet and activity logs analysis\nThroughout the trial period, participants logged the following activities on an in-house developed smartphone application ( Zeevi\net al., 2015 ): sleep and wakeup time, physical activity (type, duration and intensity), meals, snacks, and drinks (ingredients and quan-\ntities), and medications. Participants were monitored at near-real-time for compliance in recording food and activity and contacted\nby phone as needed. To limit confounding of the dietary analysis by poor or insuf\ufb01cient logging of meals, we included in the \ufb01nal\nanalysis only participants that had at least 20 days with at least 1,000 kcal logged per day; the number of analyzed individualswas not signi\ufb01cantly different between the groups.\nGlucose tolerance tests in conventionalized germ-free mice\nGerm-free Swiss-Webster WT adult (seven to nine-week-old) male mice served as recipients for fecal microbiome transplants and\nwere housed in sterile isolators (Park Bioservices). Fecal samples from human donors were frozen immediately after collection and\nwere stored in a -80C freezer prior to processing. Two hundred mg of frozen stool was resuspended in 5 ml of sterile PBS underanaerobic conditions (Coy Laboratory Products, 75% N\n2, 20% CO 2,5 %H 2), vortexed for 3 min and allowed to settle by gravity\nfor 2 min. The anaerobic homogenate was transferred to the animal facility in airtight Hungate tubes placed in anaerobic pouches\n(GasPak /C212EZ Anaerobe Pouch System). Transplant into recipient mice was achieved by gavage with 200 ml of the supernatant.\nMice were maintained on normal chow diet and water throughout the experiment. Mice were kept in iso-cages with suf\ufb01cientfood and water and were not handled until a glucose tolerance test was performed seven days post-conventionalization. Transplan-\ntation ef\ufb01cacy was determined by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of each recipient mouse to its corresponding human donor, and was com-\nparable between mouse recipients of top and bottom sucralose responder microbiomes and between mouse recipients of baselineand day 21 microbiomes. For glucose tolerance tests , mice were fasted for 6 h during the light phase, with free access to water.ll\nCell 185, 3307\u20133328.e1\u2013e5, September 1, 2022 e3ArticleBlood from the tail vein was used to measure glucose levels using a glucometer (Bayer) immediately before and 15, 30, 60, 90 and\n120 min after oral gavage feeding with 40 mg glucose (J. T. Baker). In all experiments, each experimental group consisted of at least\ntwo cages to minimize cage-effects. To ensure sterility of the mice for this primary readout, additional metabolic outputs that require\nbaseline measurements (e.g., weight) were not recorded.\nShotgun metagenomic sequencing\nIllumina libraries were prepared using a Nextera DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, 20034198) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocoland sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform with a read length of 75 bp (single-end) for all samples.\nMetagenomic analysis of stool and oral microbiome samples\nFor human microbiome samples, data from the Illumina NextSeq sequencer were converted to fastq \ufb01les with bcl2fastq, resulting in1222 stool samples and 735 oral samples (9948552 \u00b13440344 average and standard deviation of reads per sample). Sequences\nwere then QC trimmed using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 ) with parameters PE -threads 10 -phred33 ILLUMINACLIP:\nNexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:50 and host sequences were removed using KneadData with default pa-rameters using the hg19 reference. We then subsampled all the samples to 1M sequences for stool samples and 250,000 for oral\nsamples, removing all samples below this threshold and retaining 1182 stool and 713 oral samples. We removed 40 additional\noral samples due to contamination (de\ufb01ned as abundance of >1% for six or more of the top ten abundant species in stool). Kraken2(Wood et al., 2019 ) was used for taxonomic analysis with a pre-built index database ( Me\u00b4ric et al., 2019 ) and Bracken ( Lu et al., 2017 )\nwas applied to estimate genus and species abundances. For functional annotations, we used both HUMAnN2 ( Franzosa et al., 2018 )\nas well as an in-house analytic pipeline. HUMAnN2 was used with the uniref90 ( Suzek et al., 2007 ) as the protein database and Choc-\nophlan ( Franzosa et al., 2018 ) as the nucleotide database; the path abundance unstrati\ufb01ed output with MetaCyc ( Caspi et al., 2018 )\nannotations was taken. The in-house pipeline consists of the following steps: \ufb01rst, we use diamond ( Buch\ufb01nk et al., 2021 ) against the\nhuman gut IGC ( Li et al., 2014 ) reference which was \ufb01ltered to contain only KEGG ( Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 ) annotated entries with\nparameters \u2013max-hsps 1 -k 1 -e 0.0001. We then sum all the hits for each gene divided by its length and grouped to KEGG Orthologsand relative abundance is calculated. Pathways and Modules were computed using EMPANADA ( Manor and Borenstein, 2017 ). For\ndimensionality reduction of longitudinal microbiome data, participant microbiome trajectories were computed as the fold change\nfrom the baseline measurements averages, followed by application of M-product based Tensor Component Analysis (TCAM). Mousesamples were processed in a similar manner, with a total of 91 stool samples, and using the mm10 mouse genome reference. Mice\nsamples were subsampled to 2.5M reads.\nUntargeted metabolomics\nMetabolite extraction\nExtraction and analysis of lipids and polar/semipolar metabolites was performed as previously described ( Malitsky et al., 2016 ;Zheng\net al., 2015 ) with some modi\ufb01cations: 90 ml of serum were extracted with 1 mL of a pre-cooled ( /C020C) homogenous methanol:methyl-\ntert-butyl-ether (MTBE) 1:3 (v/v) mixture, containing following internal standards: 0.1 mg*mL\n-1of Phosphatidylcholine (17:0/17:0)\n(Avanti), 0.4 mg*mL-1of Phosphatidylethanolamine (17:0/17:0, 0.15 nmol*mL-1of Ceramide/Sphingoid Internal Standard Mixture I\n(Avanti, LM6002), 0.0267 mg/mL d5-TG Internal Standard Mixture I (Avanti, LM6000) and 0.1 mg*mL-1Palmitic acid-13C (Sigma,\n605573). The tubes were vortexed and then sonicated for 30 min in ice-cold sonication bath (taken for a brief vortex every\n10 min). Then, UPLC-grade water: methanol (3:1, v/v) solution (0.5 mL) containing internal following standards: C13 and N15 labeled\namino acids standard mix (Sigma) was added to the tubes followed by centrifugation. The upper, organic phase was transferred into2 mL Eppendorf tube. The polar phase was re-extracted as described above, with 0.5 mL of MTBE. Both organic phases were com-bined and dried in speedvac and then stored at /C080C until analysis. For analysis, the lower, polar phase was used for polar and semi-\npolar metabolite analysis was lyophilized and resuspended in 200 mL Methanol:DDW (50:50).\nLC-MS for semipolar metabolites processingMetabolic pro\ufb01ling of semipolar phase was performed using Waters ACQUITY UPLC system coupled to a Vion IMS QTof mass spec-\ntrometer (Waters Corp., MA, USA). The LC separation was as previously described ( Itkin et al., 2011 ) with minor alterations. Brie\ufb02y,\nthe chromatographic separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 3100 mm, i.d., 1.7 mm) (Waters Corp.,\nMA, USA). The mobile phase A consisted of 95% DDW and 5% acetonitrile, with 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B consisted of\n100% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The column was maintained at 35C, and the \ufb02ow rate of the mobile phase was 0.3 mL*\nmin\n-1. Mobile phase A was initially run at 100%, and it was gradually reduced to 72% at 22 min, following a decrease to 0% at\n36 min. Then, mobile phase B was run at 100% until 38 min; then, mobile phase A was set to 100% at 38.5 min. Finally, the column\nwas equilibrated at 100% mobile phase A until 40 min. MS parameters were as follows: the source and de-solvation temperatures\nwere maintained at 120C and 350C, respectively. The capillary voltage was set to 2 kV at negative ionization mode; cone voltage wasset for 40 V. Nitrogen was used as de-solvation gas and cone gas at the \ufb02ow rate of 700 L*h\n-1and 50 L*h-1. The mass spectrometer\nwas operated in full scan HDMSEnegative or positive resolution mode over a mass range of 50\u20132000 Da. For the high-energy scan\nfunction, a collision energy ramp of 20\u201380 eV was applied; for the low energy scan function \u2013 4 eV was applied. Leucine-enkephalin\nwas used as a lock-mass reference standard.ll\ne4 Cell 185, 3307\u20133328.e1\u2013e5, September 1, 2022ArticleSemipolar compounds identi\ufb01cation and data processing\nLC-MS data were analyzed and processed with UNIFI (Version 1.9.4, Waters Corp., MA, USA). The putative identi\ufb01cation of the\ndifferent semipolar species was performed by comparison accurate mass, fragmentation pattern and ion mobility (CCS) values to\nin-house made semipolar database, when several compounds were identi\ufb01ed vs. standards, when available.LC-MS polar metabolite analysis\nMetabolic pro\ufb01ling of polar phase was done as previously described ( Zheng et al., 2015 ) with minor modi\ufb01cations described below.\nBrie\ufb02y, analysis was performed using Acquity I class UPLC System combined with mass spectrometer Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap /C212\n(Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c) which was operated in a negative ionization mode. The LC separation was done using the SeQuant Zic-pHilic (150 mm 32.1 mm) with the SeQuant guard column (20 mm 32.1 mm) (Merck). The Mobile phase B: acetonitrile and Mobile\nphase A: 20 mM ammonium carbonate with 0.1% ammonia hydroxide in DDW: acetonitrile (80:20, v/v). The \ufb02ow rate was kept at\n200mL* min\n/C01and gradient as follow: 0-2 min 75% of B, 14 min 25% of B, 18 min 25% of B, 19 min 75% of B, for 4 min, 23 min\n75% of B. For metabolites normalization, peak areas of metabolites were divided by summed relative abundances of internal stan-\ndards (labeled amino acids). Further normalization was carried out by dividing each metabolite with the median value of that metab-\nolite, as it was shown to produce the most accurate results ( Wulff and Mitchell, 2018 ). Statistical tests were employed using repeated\nmeasures one way ANOVA for testing of three time points, and by paired t-test for the two time point analysis (for the sucralose and\ncontrol groups), FDR-BH correction was applied. For pathway analysis P-value signi\ufb01cant metabolites of the sucralose group were\nrun in the MetaboAnalyst pipeline ( Pang et al., 2021 ) using the hypergeometric test and the KEGG ( Homo Sapiens ) database.\nPolar metabolites data processingThe data processing was done using TraceFinder (Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c), when detected compounds were identi\ufb01ed by accurate\nmass, retention time, isotope pattern, fragments and veri\ufb01ed using in-house-generated mass spectra library.\nQUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nThe sample size for the RCT was calculated to have a power of >80% to detect a 30% increase in glucose tolerance (GTT AUC) with a\nprobability of a type I error ( a) of 0.05. This value is based on our preliminary trial, in which we observed an average increase in GTT\nAUC of 1000 units in saccharin-supplemented individuals ( Suez et al., 2014 ). In all linear mixed-effects models, participants were\nconsidered as the random effect, re\ufb02ected as donors in the mouse modeling. In the mouse modelling, we used either responsiveness(top, bottom) or time point (baseline, day 21) as the response variable, while the bacterial feature (gene, pathway, or bacterial species)\nwas used as the explanatory variable. PERMANOVA was used with the strati\ufb01cation of participants when performing the random\npermutations. For the correlation analysis, we used the average of all mice relating to the same donor and time point to handlerepeated samples. Statistical tests were performed in PRISM (V 9.2), R and Python. The tests used in each analysis are indicatedin the main text. Types of center and dispersion measures are indicated in the \ufb01gure legends. PRISM was used as the primary\ntool for statistical analysis, apart from the microbiome linear mixed modelling (R, lmer package) and microbiome PERMANOVA\nand univariate testing (Python). The AUC of log fold change was computed only for the topmost informative features detected byTCAM in primary PCs. The computation was performed by taking the cumulative sum of the log\n2fold change from baseline values\nof each feature, unrelated to the TCAM algorithm computation.\nData integrity check\nFigure and supplementary \ufb01gure panels were checked for data integrity using the Proo\ufb01g pipeline, https://www.proo\ufb01g.com .ll\nCell 185, 3307\u20133328.e1\u2013e5, September 1, 2022 e5ArticleSupplemental \ufb01gures\n(legend on next page)ll\nArticleFigure S1.

The colon alone, which contains the largest population of\nthe diverse human microbiota, can harbor up to 100 trillion bacteria. The gut microbiota is essential\nin maintaining normal gut physiology and health. Therefore, its disruption in humans is often\nassociated with various pathological conditions. Different factors can in\ufb02uence the composition\nand function of the gut microbiota, including host genetics, age, antibiotic treatments, environment,\nand diet. The diet has a marked effect, impacting the gut microbiota composition, bene\ufb01cially or\ndetrimentally, by altering some bacterial species and adjusting the metabolites produced in the\ngut environment. With the widespread use of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) in the diet, recent\ninvestigations have focused on their effect on the gut microbiota as a mediator of the potential\nimpact generated by gastrointestinal-related disturbances, such as insulin resistance, obesity, and\nin\ufb02ammation. We summarized the results from pre-clinical and clinical studies published over the\nlast ten years that examined the single effects of the most consumed NNS: aspartame, acesulfame-K,\nsucralose, and saccharin. Pre-clinical studies have given con\ufb02icting results for various reasons,\nincluding the administration method and the differences in metabolism of the same NNS among\nthe different animal species. A dysbiotic effect of NNS was observed in some human trials, but\nmany other randomized controlled trials reported a lack of signi\ufb01cant impacts on gut microbiota\ncomposition. These studies differed in the number of subjects involved, their dietary habits, and\ntheir lifestyle; all factors related to the baseline composition of gut microbiota and their response to\nNNS. The scienti\ufb01c community still has no unanimous consensus on the appropriate outcomes and\nbiomarkers that can accurately de\ufb01ne the effects of NNS on the gut microbiota.\nKeywords: gut microbiota; non-nutritive sweetener; aspartame; acesulfame; sucralose; saccharin\n1. The Gut Microbiota\nThe human gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem consisting of over 1500 species\nof bacteria distributed across more than 50 phyla [ 1]. About 30\u201340 species comprise over\n99% of the total bacterial population, with up to 100 trillion bacteria residing in the large\nintestine alone [ 2,3]. The microbiota composition varies between individuals and can be\ncategorized as either eubiosis, a healthy microbiota with a balance of bene\ufb01cial bacterial\nspecies [ 4], or dysbiosis, a microbial imbalance that can lead to pathological outcomes.\nMicrobial communities are unique to each host and can change rapidly due to various\nenvironmental factors, including diet [5].\nThe human gut microbiota comprises various categories of microbes, including bac-\nteria, archaea, eukarya, viruses, and parasites [ 6]. The gut microenvironment favors the\ngrowth of bacteria from seven predominant divisions: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Acti-\nnobacteria, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Cyanobacteria [ 7]. The\nBacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the dominant bacterial populations in the gastrointestinal\nNutrients 2023 ,15, 1869. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15081869 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrientsNutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 2 of 29\ntract, accounting for over 90% of the total population [ 8] (Figure 1). The phylum Bac-\nteroidetes consist of nearly 7000 different species of Gram-negative bacteria, primarily from\nthe genera Bacteroides ,Alistipes ,Parabacteroides , and Prevotella (Figure 1).

The \nF/B ratio commonly varies between 0.1 when the Firmicutes are 1/10 of the Bacteroidetes \nto 10 when the Firmicutes are ten times the Bacteroidetes [13,14]. Alterations in the abun-\ndance of specific Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes species can affect the F/B ratio.

The balance of the intestinal ecosys-\ntem is crucial for maintaining the physio logical function of the human body, and various \ntherapeutic approaches aim to achieve a balanced F/B ratio [11]. However, while the F/B \nratio can indicate dysbiosis in the gut microbiota, contradictory results in the literature \nmake it difficult to relate the F/B ratio to health and specifically consider it a hallmark of \nobesity or IBD [12,13].  \nIndividuals vary in the ir abundance of bacterial phyla regardless of their enterotypes. \nSome bacteria are considered \u201ccore microbiota\u201d because they are consistent be tween in-\ndividuals, while others are more similar to  a \u201cflexible pool\u201d that can adapt to the host.

For example, certain genes were\nfound in a marine bacterium living in red algae, and these same genes were also found\nin the gut bacterium of Japanese individuals due to their consumption of seaweed that is\ntraditionally used to prepare sushi [17].\nThe gut microbiota is essential for the proper functioning of the host organism. It helps\nprotect against pathogens by colonizing mucosal surfaces and producing antimicrobial\nsubstances. In addition, it plays a critical role in digestion, metabolism [ 18], and the\nimmune system [ 19] and controls the growth and differentiation of epithelial cells [ 20]. The\nmicrobiota can also impact insulin resistance and secretion [ 21,22] and affect the host\u2019s\nmental and neurological functions by in\ufb02uencing brain-gut communication [23].\nThe gut microbiota inhabits and reproduces on the surfaces of the intestines, forming\na stable environment that helps prevent the in\ufb01ltration of harmful microorganisms [ 24,25].\nFurthermore, the metabolic functions of the gut microbiota encompass the breakdown of\nindigestible substances through anaerobic fermentation, generating short-chain fatty acids\n(SCFAs). These SCFAs participate in glucose [ 26] and lipid metabolism, regulate appetite\nand support the immune system [ 27]. They are also a crucial energy source for intestinal\nepithelial cells, reinforcing the mucosal barrier [ 28,29]. Additionally, SCFAs are receiving\nsigni\ufb01cant attention for their potential to promote human health since studies have shown\nthat they may have anti-in\ufb02ammatory and chemopreventive properties, making them a\npromising candidate for tumor suppression [ 27]. Given the gut microbiota\u2019s crucial role in\npreserving a healthy gut function [ 30,31] and overall human health, its disruption is often\nassociated with various diseases, including autoimmune diseases [ 32], in\ufb02ammatory bowel\ndiseases [33], cardiovascular disease [30,31], allergies [34], obesity and diabetes [35].\n2. Effects of Diet on Gut Microbiota\nSeveral factors can affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota, includ-\ning host genetics, age [ 36], the mode of birth [ 37], antibiotic treatments [ 38], as well as\nenvironmental factors, including built and socioeconomic environments [ 18,39,40]. Diet\nis also essential in either a bene\ufb01cial or harmful way by modifying bacterial species and\nadjusting the metabolites produced in the gut [ 41]. Diet is an essential factor that affects\nthe development of the gut microbiota in newborn infants as it adapts to varying nutrient\navailability. During early infancy, the gut microbiota comprises genes that facilitate the\nbreakdown of oligosaccharides in breast milk. Simultaneously, the introduction of solid\nfoods leads to an increased abundance of genes related to the metabolism of polysaccha-\nrides and vitamins [ 42]. After infancy, diet becomes one of the main keys to organizing the\ngut microbiota\u2019s structure, shape, and variety [38].\nDifferent diets have a distinct impact on gut microbiota. Vegetarian diets may be\nrelated to changing microbiota species, resulting in the dominance of Firmicutes and\nBacteroidetes [ 43]. Dietary \ufb01ber consumption is essential to maintain the integrity of the\ngut mucosal barrier function [ 44]. By contrast, a diet rich in protein and fats have been\ncorrelated with an abundance of Bacteroidetes, such as Bacteroides ,Bilophila , and Alistipes ,\nthat are able to resist disruptive antibacterial compounds in the bile and the suppression\nof Firmicutes [ 45]. Increasing consumption of this diet may lower immunity and increase\nsusceptibility to infection and metabolic diseases [46].\nThe excessive intake of simple sugars can proceed beyond the small intestine\u2019s ability\nto absorb carbohydrates, leading to the provision of easily available substrates for bacterial\ngrowth in the colon and distal small intestine [ 47]. In addition, diets high in carbohy-\ndrates lead to a signi\ufb01cant reduction in microbial variety, accompanied by an increase\nin saccharolytic bacteria in fecal matter, which is not typically present in the distal colon,\nregardless of the glycemic index of various high-carbohydrate fruits [ 48,49]. Some studies\nhave indicated that a diet high in sucrose can change the function of Lactobacillus plantarum\nin the gastrointestinal system and lead to sucrose-induced dysbiosis, characterized by a\nsurge in Clostridia and Bacilli and signi\ufb01cant declines in Lactobacillus spp., Sphingomonas ,\nand Klebsiella [50,51].Nutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 4 of 29\nResearch in recent years has emphasized the interplay between the microbiota and\nthe host and how the composition of the human gut microbiota can potentially impact the\nonset of various diseases, including metabolic syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and type\n1 diabetes [ 52]. These \ufb01ndings suggest that changes in the composition and function of\nthe gut microbiota, including those caused by diet, directly affect human health and are\nimportant in the onset of several diseases. The consumption of unhealthy diets that are\nhigh in saturated fat and re\ufb01ned sugar and a lack of physical activity has been associated\nwith dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, leading to inadequate glycemic control [ 53]. Any\nchanges in the gut microbiota\u2019s number, composition, or quality may affect the different\nphysiological roles of microbes and cause gut microbiota dysbiosis [54].\n3. Effects of Non-Nutritive Sweeteners on the Gut Microbiota\nNNS are synthetic or natural sweeteners that are several hundred to several thousand\ntimes sweeter than sucrose [ 55] but without or with very few calories. Each NNS has speci\ufb01c\nmetabolic characteristics, including a peculiar sweetness intensity and the persistence of\nthe sweet taste.\nThe inclusion of NNS as food additives and sweeteners is a recent addition to the\nhuman diet [ 56,57]. The general consumption of NNS has signi\ufb01cantly increased since\nsaccharin was authorized as the \ufb01rst NNS in 1970 [ 58], and to date, the employment of\nNNS has been prevalent as it provides a useful strategy for lowering calorie consumption\nand sugar levels [ 59,60]. There are variations across nations when it comes to the kinds\nof NNS deemed safe for human consumption, provided that the Acceptable Daily Intake\n(ADI) is adhered to and there is no established connection with cancer or other health\nproblems [ 61\u201363]. For instance, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved more\ntypes of NNS, such as cyclamate, compared to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA). However, recent research has suggested that the consumption of NNS can affect\nsome health conditions, such as glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease [ 59,64\u201366].\nThe gut microbiota has been implicated in the modi\ufb01cation of xenobiotics (e.g., phar-\nmaceutical drugs) [ 67,68], and there is evidence that it can similarly modify NNS as well [ 69].\nRecently the effect of NNS on the gut microbiota has been investigated because of their\npossible impact on insulin resistance, obesity, and in\ufb02ammation [ 57]. Several studies eval-\nuating the effects of NNS on human physiology observed that the gut microbiota acts as\na mediator of their potential effects [ 70\u201372], raising new questions regarding their safety\npro\ufb01le and the need to clarify their interactions with the host and the microbiota.\nWhile the health risks associated with excess sugar consumption are well known [ 16,73],\nour understanding is limited on whether or how NNS affects human physiology, whether\nthey act directly on the host or indirectly through the modulation of the gut microbiota.\nNNS are widely used due to their low caloric content and their ability to not affect\npost-meal appetite and energy responses. This is particularly bene\ufb01cial for diabetic patients\nand overweight/obese individuals seeking sugar substitutes. The digestive system plays\na crucial role in breaking down dietary components and facilitating nutrient absorption\nto meet the body\u2019s nutritional requirements [ 74]. On the other hand, the gut microbiota\nconsists of microorganisms that have access to dietary components before, during, and\nafter digestion and absorption and are involved in their fermentation. They help to extract\nenergy from nutritional components that the host cannot access and produce additional\nnutrients, such as vitamins, that can be utilized by the host [75].\nThe impact of this community on host growth, nutrition, and health is now better\nunderstood [ 75,76] as more instances of historical relationships between people and certain\ngut microorganisms have been discovered [ 77,78]. There is signi\ufb01cant interest in under-\nstanding how food additives interact with the gut microbiota, and recent research has\nprovided solid evidence for the in\ufb02uence of this bacterial population on the bioavailability\nand degradation of xenobiotic chemicals [ 79,80]. NNS are one of the most widely used\nfood additives [ 81], and there has been a lot of interest in \ufb01guring out whether and how\nthese substances change the gut microbiome [ 70,82,83]. This has made it even harderNutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 5 of 29\nto fully understand the mechanisms beneath the correlation between NNS intake and\ndysbiosis [84].\nRecent research has suggested that the gut microbiota, the complex community of\nmicroorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, may play a role in the metabolism of\nNNS and their effects on host health. However, only a few studies have investigated the\nmechanisms by which gut microbiota can metabolize NNS, showing that they can be used\nas a carbon source by some strains of gut bacteria, leading to changes in their metabolic\nactivity [ 70,72]. Understanding the effects of NNS on the gut microbiota, particularly on\nthose most commonly used, such as aspartame, acesulfame-K, sucralose, and saccharin, is\ncritical for assessing their impact on human health. Due to the variety of NNS\u2019 chemical\nstructures and metabolism, their peculiar activities in the gut microbiome need to be better\nunderstood, too (Figure 2).\nAspartame is structurally simple and consists of a dipeptide methyl ester containing\ntwo amino acids that are found widely in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and dairy products,\nnamely, L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine (Figure 2) [85].\nUpon consumption, gastrointestinal peptidases and esterases almost completely break\ndown aspartame, resulting in negligible amounts of the compound entering the blood-\nstream [ 85,86]. An intestinal esterase, such as chymotrypsin, removes the methyl group and\nreleases the natural dipeptide aspartyl phenylalanine. The microvillus membrane lining\nthe small intestine then metabolizes this dipeptide into its component amino acids, which\nenter the circulatory system [ 87]. Phenylalanine in the liver can be converted to tyrosine\nby phenylalanine hydrolases. However, if the body does not require excess phenylalanine,\nit is eliminated in the urine [ 88,89]. Once in systemic circulation, phenylalanine can be\ndistributed throughout the body, including the brain, where it plays an important role in\nnormal growth and development [ 85,88]. In the brain, tyrosine can further be converted\ninto neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Thus, as such,\naspartame in its whole form cannot interact directly with colonic microbiota.\nNutrients 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW  5 of 31 \n \n food additives [81], and there has been a lot of interest  in figuring out whether and how \nthese substances change the gut microbiome  [70,82,83].

In the brain, tyrosine can further \nbe converted into neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. \nThus, as such, aspartame in its whole form cannot interact directly with colonic microbi-\nota. \n \nFigure 2. Chemical structures of NNS considered in this study.  \nFigure 2. Chemical structures of NNS considered in this study.\nAcesulfame-K is a hydrophilic, organic acid derivative (Figure 2) that is absorbed\nalmost entirely in the small intestine as an intact molecule and is distributed by the blood\nto different tissues. Without undergoing any metabolism, more than 99% of ingested\nacesulfame-K is excreted in the urinary tract within the \ufb01rst 24 h, with less than 1% elimi-Nutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 6 of 29\nnated in the feces both in animals and humans [ 89,90]. The rapid absorption and urinary\nexcretion it demonstrates cause a negligible acesulfame-K concentration that reaches the\nfecal or colonic bacteria [ 89,90]. Therefore, it is improbable that this NNS could directly\naffect the colonic microbiota [89,91].\nSucralose, a disaccharide composed of 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxyfructose and 4-chloro-4-\ndeoxygalactose (Figure 2), has a very low absorption level (less than 15%) and is practically\nnot metabolized. Therefore, after intake, more than 85% of sucralose reaches the colon,\nwhich is unchanged in all species, including humans [ 89,89,92]. The small proportion\nabsorbed is then eliminated in the urine and is mainly unchanged, though two glucuronides\nof sucralose were also detected in a small proportion (approximately 2%) [ 93]. Although\nmore than 85% of the ingested sucralose contacts the colonic microbiota, 94%, and 99%\ncan be recovered in the feces without any structural change, thus indicating little to no\nintestinal metabolism [89,91].\nSaccharin is an acid that dissolves in water (Figure 2), and it is more easily absorbed by\nanimals with a lower stomach pH, such as humans and rabbits, compared to animals with\na higher stomach pH, such as rats [ 94,95]. In humans, between 85% and 95% of ingested\nsaccharin is absorbed as an intact molecule since it does not undergo gastrointestinal\nmetabolism. Once absorbed, it binds to plasma proteins, is distributed throughout the body,\nand is eliminated in urine through active tubular transport [ 89,94,96]. A small percentage\nof non-absorbed saccharin is excreted in the feces, indicating that high concentrations of\nthis NNS could change the composition of the intestinal microbial population [91].\nThis review critically reassesses these aspects and examines the possible impact of\nNNS ingestion on the gut microbiota. We made an electronic search in the literature from\n2013 to January 2023 on the following databases: PubMed MEDLINE\u00aeand Embase\u00ae.

Aspartame reduced\ncalorie intake, weight gain, and improved body composition when the rats were given a\nhigh-fat diet. However, aspartame increased fasting glucose levels and hindered insulin-\nstimulated glucose disposal in rats on both standard and high-fat diets, regardless of\nbody composition. An analysis of the gut bacterial composition in fecal samples revealed\nthat aspartame increased the total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and Clostridium leptum\nlevels [ 71]. Additionally, the high-fat diet led to a decrease in Bacteroidetes and an increase\nin Firmicutes. In contrast, aspartame administration alongside the high-fat diet mitigated an\nincrease in Firmicutes without signi\ufb01cantly affecting Bacteroidetes. The authors concluded\nthat although aspartame in\ufb02uenced the gut microbial composition, further research was\nneeded to understand the implications of these changes on the development of metabolic\ndiseases [71].\nA more recent study involving pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats fed a high-\nfat/sucrose (HFSD) diet, with or without 5\u20137 mg/kg b.w. Aspartame supplementation\nfor 18 weeks observed increased body fat in offspring at weaning from dams fed the\nHFSD diet with aspartame compared to those fed HFSD alone, along with an altered\nglucose tolerance [ 98] (Table 2). Mothers had greater levels of Akkermansia muciniphila and\nEnterobacteriaceae than their infants. The aspartame group showed decreased levels of En-\nterococcaceae, Enterococcus , and Parasutterella , as well as elevated levels of Clostridium cluster\nIVin the cecal microbiota. Once the offspring\u2019s feces were transplanted into germ-free mice,\nthe gut microbiota of the latter was changed, which also affected adiposity and glucose tol-\nerance. Additionally, both female and male offspring had increased Porphyromonadaceae\nconcentrations in their guts [98].\nFood elements play a signi\ufb01cant role in determining the makeup of the gut microbiota.\nDifferent microbiological compositions might result from variations in the overall calorie\nintake and the type of food ingested [ 35,45,70]. It is uncertain whether the changes in\nthe intestinal microbiota observed in this study were caused by the NNS alone and not\nby modi\ufb01cations triggered in the intestine by the HSFD diet itself because the intestinal\nmicrobiota could be altered by a wide range of nutritional interventions, such as the reduced\nconsumption of \ufb01ber, proteins, fat, and carbohydrates.\nThe \ufb01rst study on human subjects was a cross-sectional study published in 2015,\ninvestigating the effects of high-intensity sweetener consumption on the gut microbiota [ 99].\nThe experiment included 31 healthy individuals (65% of whom were female, with an\noverall body mass index (BMI) of 24.3) who were instructed to keep a food journal for\nfour days in a row before collecting fecal samples on the \ufb01fth day. Seven individuals had\ningested aspartame in the preceding four days, with a mean intake of 62.7 mg/day, whereas\n24 participants had never used aspartame. Similar to this, 7 of the 24 participants who did\nnot ingest acesulfame-K had daily intakes ranging from 1.7 mg to 33.2 mg on average. These\npeople weren\u2019t the same ones that ate aspartame. None of the 31 participants utilized dietary\nsaccharin, although three of them consumed both aspartame and acesulfame-K. According\nto the Healthy Eating Index-2005, the BMI, calorie consumption, total carbohydrate intake,\nand diet quality of aspartame consumers and non-consumers were comparable [ 100]. There\nwere no variations between the users of either sweetener and the non-consumers of either\nin terms of BMI or dietary traits [ 99]. Moreover, there were no changes in the overall count\nof bacteria between those who used aspartame or acesulfame-K and people who did not.\nYet compared to people who did not take any sweetener, there was a decrease in the variety\nof microorganisms (from 24 to 7 phyla) [99] (Table 2).Nutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 9 of 29\nAnother study investigated the in vitro effect of NNS on fecal bacteria. Fecal samples\nfrom 13 healthy volunteers who had not directly consumed aspartame or any other NNS\nwere fermented for 24 h in batch cultures in the presence of an aspartame-based sweetener,\nsucralose, or stevia product at concentrations corresponding to the acceptable daily intake\n(ADI) for an adult male weighing 75 kg. Only for a subset of eight participants, 16S rRNA\namplicon sequencing of the human gut microbiome and the quanti\ufb01cation of dominant\nbacterial groups were conducted. The analysis of human fecal samples fermented with\nan aspartame-based sweetener rich in maltodextrin indicated a signi\ufb01cant increase in\nBi\ufb01dobacterium and Blautia coccoides growth and a lower Bacteroides/Prevotella ratio. It must\nbe underlined that this study lacked appropriate controls since the authors did not evaluate\nthe effects of the sweetener rich in maltodextrin and aspartame alone [79].\nThe Richardson Institute for Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals at the University of\nManitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover and controlled\nclinical experiment to examine the impact of sucralose or aspartame intake on the diversity of\nthe gut microbiota [ 101]. A 12-week diet plan was followed by 17 healthy volunteers with a BMI\nof 20\u201325 within the age range of 18\u201345. For the first 4 weeks, there was a baseline period during\nwhich no artificial sweeteners were ingested by any of the subjects. Nine subjects received\naspartame, and eight received sucralose throughout weeks 5 and 6. All subjects completed a\nwashout phase between weeks 7 through 10, where no artificial sweeteners were used. Finally ,\nduring weeks 11 and 12, every subject ingested the new sweetener.\nThe study\u2019s participants were instructed to abstain from using any additional NNS and\nwere informed of the hidden sources of NNS in various foods, drinks, and pharmaceuticals.\nThey were also told not to consume any probiotic-containing meals or supplements [ 101].\nAccording to the mean adult body weight, the quantity of aspartame and sucralose that\neach participant should consume each day to meet 14% of the ADI for aspartame and\n20% of the ADI for sucralose was calculated to be 0.425 g of aspartame and 0.136 g of\nsucralose each day, respectively. These doses were determined by the normal soft drink\nconsumption habits of men and women in Canada [ 102] (Table 2). The authors considered\nthe dosage levels reasonable and realistic because they re\ufb02ected consumers\u2019 daily intake of\napproximately three cans of diet soda [101].\nMicrobiota and SCFAs were examined in the feces that had been sampled both before\nand after treatments. The most prevalent bacterial taxa (family and genus) did not alter\nin their median relative proportions between treatments with NNS and those without.\nAfter ingesting the NNS, neither the microbiota community structure nor the fecal SCFAs\nchanged (Table 2). Thus, aspartame did not cause healthy participants to change in the gut\nmicrobiota or SCFAs after 2 weeks of a realistic daily intake [101].\nIn 2022, contrasting results were obtained from a multi-arm randomized controlled\ntrial assessing the effect of aspartame and other NNS on human metabolic health and\nthe microbiota. In particular, Suez and colleagues enrolled 120 participants in this trial,\nwhich was divided into four groups (20 subjects/group) receiving aspartame, saccharin,\nsucralose, or stevia. Two control groups received glucose or no supplement [ 103]. All\nNNS were administered as commercially available sachets containing 5.76 g of glucose\nand 0.24 g of aspartame daily in a dosage of two sachets administered three times a\nday. The control group was given 5 g/day of glucose or nothing at all (Table 2). The\nexperiment was broken down into three parts: after baseline assessments of metabolic,\nmetabolomic, and microbiological parameters across 7 days, individuals were exposed to\nNNS for 14 days. Then, supplementation was stopped, and participants were monitored\nfor a further 7 days. To determine how the medication affected the gut microbiota, samples\nof the microbiota from the oral cavity and feces were taken at predetermined intervals [ 103].\nAspartame and all the other NNS signi\ufb01cantly altered the human intestinal microbiota and\nsigni\ufb01cantly affected microbiota function compared to the control groups [ 103]. However,\nwhich bacterial species increased and/or decreased was not speci\ufb01ed. Aspartame also\naffected the oral microbiota, reducing the abundance of Porphyromonas and Prevotella\nnanceiensis (Table 2) [103].Nutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 10 of 29\nTable 2.

Effect of Acesulfame-K\nThe effects of acesulfame-K on the gut microbiota and fecal metabolic pro\ufb01les were\nexplored in animals (Table 3). In 8-week-old CD-1 mice, acesulfame-K was administered\nby gavage for 4 weeks, at 37.5 mg/kg b.w./day, and was investigated by 16S rRNA\nsequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics [ 105].Bacteroides\nwere greatly increased in acesulfame-K-treated male mice, with signi\ufb01cant changes in\ntwo other genera, Anaerostipes and Sutterella . In female mice, acesulfame-K dramatically\nlowered the relative abundance of numerous genera, including Lactobacillus ,Clostridium ,\nan unassigned Ruminococcaceae genus, and an unassigned Oxalobacteraceae genus, and\nincreased the abundance of Mucispirillum [105]. High gender-speci\ufb01c body weight gain,\nshifts in the gut bacterial community composition, an enrichment of functional bacterial\ngenes related to energy metabolism, and fecal metabolomic changes were also observed. In\nparticular, acesulfame-K increased body weight gain in male but not female mice [105].\nUebanso and colleagues obtained different results, reporting that the intake of\n15 mg/kg b.w./day acesulfame-K, corresponding to the maximum ADI level, did not affect\nthe relative amount of Clostridium cluster XIVa in the fecal microbiota [ 106]. In this study,\n4-week-old male mice were allowed free access to a standard diet (AIN93G; Oriental Yeast)\nand were treated for 8 weeks with a solution containing 15 mg/kg b.w./day acesulfame-K\nor the same volume of distilled water [ 106]. Acesulfame-K did not increase food intake,\nbody weight gain, liver weight, or fat in the epididymis or cecum [106] (Table 3).\nRecent studies have indicated that 0.1 or 0.2 mg acesulfame-K (concentrations near the\nupper limit of human ADI), together with sucralose in pregnant mice, caused metabolic\nand microbiota alterations in the progeny [ 107] (Table 3). In particular, there was an\nincrease in Firmicutes and depletion of Akkermansia muciniphila , which is a bene\ufb01cial\nbacterium inversely correlated with fat mass gain, type 1 diabetes, and in\ufb02ammatory bowel\nsyndrome [107]. There was also an increase in the variety of species in the microbiota.\nIn a study in 2021 in which C57BL/6J mice received 150 mg/kg b.w./day acesulfame-K\nfor 8 weeks, acesulfame-K was reported to induce dysbiosis and intestinal injury with en-\nhanced lymphocyte migration to the intestinal mucosa. Decreases in the levels of Clostridiaceae ,\nLachnospiraceae , and Ruminococcaceae in the gut microbiota were also observed (Table 3) [ 108].\nThese \ufb01ndings reported in the pre-clinical studies considered here suggest a dose-\ndependent relationship between acesulfame-K intake and the dysbiotic events in the gut\nmicrobiota of mice.\nIn 2022, Murali and colleagues, to assess the in\ufb02uence of some NNS on fecal bacterial\ncomposition, treated Wistar rats of both sexes for 28 days with 40 mg/kg b.w./day and\n120 mg/kg b.w./day acesulfame [ 109]. No mortality, abnormalities, or signs of clinical\ntoxicity were observed in any of the animals in either dose group. The body weights\nof the animals and food consumption rates remained roughly the same throughout the\n28-day study. No treatment-speci\ufb01c in\ufb02uence in either the dose groups of acesulfame-Kwas\nobserved in the fecal 16S gene sequencing analysis in male and female rats compared to\nthe respective controls. This is in line with the work of Uebanso et al., who demonstrated\nthat acesulfame-Kat the maximum ADI of 15 mg/kg b.w. did not alter the gut microbiota.\nMurali et al. found that in males treated with acesulfame-K, fecal metabolites, predomi-\nnantly amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, fatty acids, and related classes, changed. How-\never, when these metabolites were compared with key indicators of microbiota-associated\nchanges in Wistar rats, based on different classes of antibiotics in 28-day studies [ 110,111],\nnone were signi\ufb01cantly altered in acesulfame-K-treated rats [109].Nutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 12 of 29\nTable 3.

In this study, as described in detail before, seven\nparticipants had consumed acesulfame-K in the four previous days with an average intake\nof 1.7 to 33.2 mg/day (Table 3). Acesulfame-K consumers were similar in BMI, energy\nintake, added sugar intake, and diet quality to non-consumers [99].\n3.3. Effect of Sucralose\nGiven that the microbial metabolism of sucralose is practically null, for studies report-\ning an effect on the intestinal microbiota, it should be veri\ufb01ed whether the experiments\nwere conducted using pure sucralose or a commercial tabletop formulation since the latter\nusually contained about 1% sucralose and 99% of carriers were maltodextrins [91].\nIn this regard, Rodriguez-Palacios and colleagues gave Splenda\u00ae(sucralose maltodextrin,\n1:99, w/w) to SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mice to quantify the impact of a 6-week supplementation\non the severity of Crohn\u2019s disease-like ileitis and intestinal microbiota alterations [ 112]. Mice\nwere given 3.5 mg/mL of Splenda\u00aein drinking water. SAMP and AKR mice (a strain widely\nused in cancer research for their high leukemia incidence and from which SAMP mice are\nderived) were treated with plain water for 6 weeks and were used as negative controls. Fecal\nbacteriome changes were subsequently assessed using a 16S rRNA microbiome.\nThe authors initially examined the gut metagenome pro\ufb01les of AKR and the SAMP\n\u201cexperimental mouse\u201d colony before investigating the effects of Splenda\u00ae. They collected\nand examined feces from six mice (three males and three females) aged 7, 22, and 50 weeks.\nBy comparing SAMP mice to AKR mice, metagenomics showed a large rise in the Bac-\nteroidetes phylum at the phylum level. At the class level, Sphingobacteria and Bacteroidia\nwere more prevalent in SAMP mice than AKR mice within the family Bacteroidetes. Collec-\ntively, Bacteroidia was more often changed in the SAMP mice compared to Sphingobacteria ,\nwhere only one genus out of six was elevated. The 16S microbiome research revealed\nthat Splenda\u00aetreatment resulted in a highly extensive promotion of bacterial species\nthroughout the \ufb01ve classes of the Proteobacteria phylum, which was the most consistent\nimpact ( Alphaproteobacteria ,Betaproteobacteria ,Epsilonproteobacteria ,Deltaproteobacteria , and\nGammaproteobacteria). Moreover, Splenda\u00aestimulated the substantial development of\nEscherichia coli at the cost of streptococcus-like bacteria in the feces of mice [112].\nIn mice given 5 mg/kg b.w./day sucralose for 3 or 6 months, there was an enrichment\nof intestinal bacterial pro-in\ufb02ammatory genes and a disruption in fecal metabolites, in ad-\ndition to an increase in hepatic pro-in\ufb02ammatory gene expression observed after 6 months\nof treatment (Table 4). These data suggest that sucralose at a dose level close to the human\nADI may increase the risk of in\ufb02ammation by disrupting the gut microbiota [72].\nDysbiosis from sucralose intake was also reported in another study by Wang and\ncolleagues, where 5-week-old mice were fed a normal or high-fat chow diet for 8 weeks,\nwith a drinking solution containing 2.5% ( w/v) sucralose. Based on water consumption,\nsucralose intake was ~3.3 mg/kg b.w./day for mice fed a normal diet and ~1.5 mg/kg\nb.w./day for those fed the high-fat diet [ 113]. In mice fed the standard diet with sucralose,\nthere was an increase in Firmicutes, which further increased when sucralose was provided\nin the high-fat diet (Table 4) [113].\nHowever, the Uebanso study reported that, in mice, pure sucralose (14.2 mg/kg b.w./day)\nfor 8 weeks reduced the relative amount of Clostridium cluster XIVa in the fecal microbiota [ 106].\nA dysbiotic effect was also observed in the pups of dams treated for 6 weeks with sucralose\ntogether with 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg b.w./day acesulfame-K; in these, the intestinal levels of\nFirmicutes doubled, including the Clostridiales families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae\n(e.g., Oscillospira ) [107] (Table 4).\nAccording to these \ufb01ndings, Dai and colleagues examined the impact of maternal\nsucralose consumption on the propensity of kids to develop hepatic steatosis as adults [ 114].\nA sucralose solution of 0.1 mg/mL was administered to C57BL/6 pregnant mice that were\nrandomly assigned to either the maternal sucralose group or the maternal control group forNutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 14 of 29\nthe duration of gestation (3 weeks) and lactation (3 weeks). All young were fed a controlled\ndiet after weaning for 8 weeks, followed by a high-fat diet for another 4 weeks. The 12th\nweek was then used to evaluate the gut microbiota. After a 4-week high-fat diet, the authors\nfound that maternal sucralose intake worsened intestinal dysbiosis in 12-week-old kids.\nYet, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria increased in relative abundance. Bacteroidetes decreased\nconcurrently in the maternal sucralose and control groups. Nevertheless, Proteobacteria\u2019s\nabundance dramatically decreased in the maternal sucralose group compared to the control\ngroup after 9 weeks of a high-fat diet [ 114]. Since no 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis\nwas conducted, there was no clear information on the difference in the gut microbiota\ncomposition between the maternal sucralose and control groups.\nIn the 2022 study by Zheng and colleagues, mice were treated with 0.0003\u20130.3 mg/mL of\nsucralose (0.3 mg/mL of sucralose was equal to the ADI of 5 mg/kg b.w./day established by\nthe FDA) [ 115]. The liver was removed from each mouse after 16 weeks, weighed, and the\ncontents of the jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon were collected. While sucralose affected the\nfunction of the intestinal barrier, there was no change in body weight. Sucralose dramatically\naltered the makeup of the gut microbiota, particularly at concentrations of 0.3 mg/mL or\nabove, which increased the numbers of potential pathogens such as T enacibaculum ,Ruegeria ,\nand Staphylococcus in the jejunum, ileum, and colon. At this dose, sucralose also increased\nAllobaculum , which was reported to be positively correlated with diabetes. A reduction in\nLachnoclostridium and Lachnospiraceae was also found in the cecum compared with the controls\ngiven in water) [115].\nIn 2019, the composition of the intestinal microbiota in healthy subjects consuming\nsucralose was examined for the \ufb01rst time in a randomized, controlled, double-blind study.\nA group of 34 healthy male volunteers received 780 mg/day of sucralose in a capsule or\na capsule containing a placebo for 7 days (Table 4). The dose of sucralose corresponded\nto 75% of the ADI [ 116]. No changes in glycemic control, insulin resistance, and intestinal\nmicrobiota at the phylum level were seen in subjects receiving sucralose (Table 4) [ 116\u2013118].\nThe results were different in another study in which fermentation for 24 h of fecal\nsamples from 13 healthy volunteers, together with 5 mg/kg sucralose, increased the growth\nofBi\ufb01dobacterium and Blautia coccoides and reduced the Bacteroides/Prevotella ratio (Table 4).\nThe production of long SCFA valeric acid also increased, indicating that sucralose affected\nthe synthesis of SCFA [79].\nThe randomized, double-blind crossover and controlled clinical trial by Ahmad and\ncolleagues [ 101] on volunteers treated for 2 weeks with 0.136 g/day sucralose found no\ndifferences in the gut microbiota composition (family and genus) before and after the\nintake [101] (Table 4).\nMore recently, two additional studies were published. The first was an open-label,\nrandomized clinical trial with 47 healthy volunteers who did not habitually consume sucralose-\ncontaining products and agreed to avoid consuming any non-caloric sweeteners during the\nstudy [ 119]. These subjects were also instructed to follow a balanced diet of vegetables, fruits,\ngrains, proteins, and dairy products, which were recommended according to their physical\nactivity level. They were monitored weekly by phone interviews [ 119]. Each day for 10 weeks,\nparticipants used bottles containing 60 mL of sterile water or 48 mg of sucralose dissolved in\n60 mL of sterile water (Table 4). This daily dose of sucralose resembled the daily consumption\nof four packets of commercial Splenda\u00ae, representing less than 15% of the ADI set by the\nFDA and less than 5% of the ADI established by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization\n(FAO)/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) [ 120]. At the\nend of the trial, bacterial DNA was isolated from stool samples of the control and intervention\ngroups. There were no differences in the level of Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium longum , as\nwell as Bacteroidetes, between the control and sucralose groups. V olunteers drinking sucralose\npresented a significant decrease at the end of the study in the relative abundance of Firmicutes,\nparticularly Lactobacillus acidophilus , compared to their basal level. However, no differences\nwere observed in the level of Firmicutes between the control and treated groups at the end of\nthe study .

A significant alteration of the human intestinal microbiota was observed in volunteers\nreceiving sucralose, although the bacterial species that were impaired were not specified.\nModifications of the oral microbiota were also observed in six Streptococcus species [ 103]; in\nparticular, concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius and oral taxon 064 decreased; meanwhile,\nlevels of Streptococcus pneumoniae , DORA-10, HMSC073F11, and KR increased.\n3.4. Effect of Saccharin\nIn 2014 a study was published investigating the effect of saccharin on the gut micro-\nbiota of mice or humans [ 70]. The authors examined the fecal microbiota of mice before and\nafter 5 weeks of treatment with 5 mg/kg b.w. saccharin by sequencing their 16S ribosomal\nRNA gene. Water or water supplemented with glucose (concentration not disclosed) was\ngiven as a control. Mice drinking saccharin had a distinct microbiota composition clustered\nseparately from their starting microbiota con\ufb01gurations. Both the control groups were the\nwater group at week 5 and the glucose-supplemented water at week 11. Compared to the\ncontrols, the microbiota of saccharin-consuming mice displayed considerable dysbiosis,\nwith an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides genus\nand Clostridiales order and a reduction in Lactobacillus reuteri [70].\nIn the same studies, the effect of saccharin in humans was examined in seven healthy\nvolunteers (\ufb01ve males and two females, aged 28\u201336) who consumed 5 mg/kg b.w./day\nsaccharin for 6 days. This dose corresponds to the FDA\u2019s maximal ADI for saccharin.\nDuring the experiment, volunteers did not ingest any other sources of saccharin or NNS.\nAt the end of the intervention, four of the seven volunteers developed impaired glucose\ntolerance (responders), and three did not (non-responders) [ 70], suggesting that there was\nan individual glucose response to saccharin that might be mediated by differences in gut mi-\ncrobiota composition. As shown by 16S rRNA fecal analysis, the microbiota con\ufb01gurations\nof saccharin responders clustered differently from non-responders before and after NNS\nconsumption. Microbiotas from non-responders presented small changes in composition\nduring the study week. In contrast, compositional changes were pronounced in responders.\nThere was a 20-fold relative increase in Bacteroides fragilis (order Bacteroidales ) and Weissella\ncibaria (order Lactobacillales ) and an approximately 10-fold decrease in Candidatus arthromitus\n(order Clostridiales ) [70].\nTo study whether this saccharin-induced dysbiosis has a causal role in generating\nglucose intolerance, the stools from responders and non-responder volunteers before (day 1)\nor after (day 7) saccharin exposure were transferred into germ-free mice. The transfer of\nstools collected on day seven from responder volunteers receiving saccharin, but not that\ncollected on day 1, induced signi\ufb01cant glucose intolerance in recipient mice. In addition,\nthe microbiota of these transplanted mice replicated some of the donor saccharin-induced\ndysbiosis. No glucose intolerance was observed in mice transplanted with stools collected\non day 7 from non-responders [70].\nIn 2017, another study reported saccharin\u2019s in\ufb02uence on gut microbiota composi-\ntion [ 121]. Bian et al. treated C57BL/6J male mice with saccharin dissolved in drinking\nwater at 0.3 mg/mL for 6 months. To investigate changes in gut microbiota, 16S rRNA\ngene sequencing was employed in fecal samples collected at different time points. Sac-\ncharin induced signi\ufb01cant changes in the mouse gut microbiota, which was manifested\nby gut bacteria alterations [ 121]. At the baseline, the relative abundance of bacteria did\nnot signi\ufb01cantly differ between the treatment and control groups; however, a signi\ufb01cant\ndistinction was observed at 3 or 6 months or both. In particular, eleven genera were sig-\nni\ufb01cantly changed after a 3- and 6-month treatment, indicating the effect of saccharin on\ndisrupting the dynamics of gut microbiota development. Speci\ufb01cally, Sporosarcina ,Jeot-\ngalicoccus ,Akkermansia ,Oscillospira , and Corynebacterium were signi\ufb01cantly higher after a\n3-month consumption; Corynebacterium ,Roseburia , and Turicibacter were increased after\n6 months. Anaerostipes and Ruminococcus were signi\ufb01cantly lower after a 3-month consump-Nutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 19 of 29\ntion; Ruminococcus ,Adlercreutzia , and Dorea were lower after 6 months of consumption [ 121].\nAdditionally, levels of hepatic pro-in\ufb02ammatory genes, such as inducible nitric oxide syn-\nthase and TNF- \u000b, increased after 6 months of treatment [ 121]. These results indicate that\nsaccharin might perturb the gut microbiota, consistent with Suez et al.\u2019s report [70].\nNo effects on gut microbiota were reported in a study in 2019 [ 122] (Table 5) in which\ndogs were fed for 10 days with a diet containing 5% cellulose, 5% \ufb01ber, and a prebiotic\nblend, 0.02% of SUCRAM\u00ae(an arti\ufb01cial sweetener consisting of 50% saccharin in addition\nto neohesperidin dihydrochalcone) and eugenol, or 5% \ufb01ber, a prebiotic blend plus 0.02%\nof saccharin and eugenol. The diets containing saccharin did not affect the proportions of\nbacterial phyla or fecal microbial composition [122].\nSimilar data were obtained in 2021 by Serrano and colleagues, whose double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled, parallel-arm study explored the effects of pure saccharin on gut micro-\nbiota and glucose tolerance in 46 healthy subjects [ 123]. The participants were randomized\ninto four treatment groups for 2 weeks of capsules containing 400 mg/day of sodium\nsaccharin, 670 mg/day of lactisole, 400 mg/day of sodium saccharin, and 670 mg/day of\nlactisole or 1000 mg/day of a pulp \ufb01ller/placebo. In parallel, the authors ran a 10-week\nstudy administering pure saccharin at a high dose (250 mg/kg bw/day) in the drinking\nwater of chow-fed mice with genetic ablation of sweet taste receptors (T1R2-KO) and wild-\ntype (WT) littermate controls. In humans and mice, pure saccharin supplementation did not\nalter microbial diversity or composition at any taxonomic level in humans and mice alike,\nand none of the interventions affected glucose or hormonal responses to an oral glucose\ntolerance test or glucose absorption in mice [ 123] (Table 5). These results indicate that short-\nterm saccharin consumption at the maximum acceptable levels established by JECFA did\nnot modify healthy humans\u2019 gut microbiota and glucose tolerance [ 123]. However, more\nrecently, a randomized controlled trial reported that the daily intake of 180 mg saccharin\nand 5820 mg glucose for 2 weeks, but not glucose alone, altered the gut microbiota and\nreduced the relative abundance of Fusobacterium in the oral microbiota [103].\nIn Murali and colleagues\u2019 28-day oral toxicity study [ 109], saccharin was administered\nto Wistar rats. The saccharin was prepared in a 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)\nsuspension at doses of 20 mg/kg b.w./day and 100 mg/kg b.w./day and administered by\ngavage to \ufb01ve rats per treatment group per sex. The saccharin doses, which were 4 and\n20 times the ADI of 5 mg/kg body weight, did not alter bacterial diversity compared to\nthe controls. Serrano et al., 2021 made a similar observation when an even higher dose\nof saccharin (250 mg/kg b.w.) was supplemented and did not cause any gut microbiota\nchanges in either mice or humans [123].\nConsistent with Serrano\u2019s \ufb01nding, even though Murali and colleagues [ 109] observed\nan overall increase in intra-group variability in the NNS-treatment groups, there were very\nfew signi\ufb01cant alterations in the 16S bacterial compositions. For example, whether greater\n\ufb02uctuations in the bacterial family Verrucomicrobiaceae were treatment-related is uncertain,\nas this bacterial family was also widely variable in the controls [ 109]. Lastly, the saccharin\n100 mg/kg bw/day treatment group showed a clear sex-dependent effect on changed fecal\nmetabolites, but overall there was no marked impact on the fecal metabolomes in either\nsex [109].Nutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 20 of 29\nTable 5.

Adding saccharin to the basal diet increased\nthe cecal Lactobacillus populations, particularly Lactobacillus OTU4228 [124] (Table 5). The\naddition of SUCRAM\u00aeto the standard diet was also reported as reducing post-weaning\nenteric disorders, enhancing health, and reducing the mortality of early-weaned piglets [ 125]\n(Table 5). The pyrosequencing of pig cecal 16S rRNA gene amplicons identified 25 major\nfamilies encompassing seven bacterial classes, with Bacteroidia ,Clostridia , and Bacilli domi-\nnating the microbiota in pigs maintained on a standard diet, which was modified in animals\nreceiving a diet containing SUCRAM\u00ae. The most notable change was a significant increase\nin the Lactobacillaceae population abundance, almost entirely due to a single phylotype,\ndesignated Lactobacillus OTU4228 . It was concluded that the artificial sweetener, modifying\nthe gut microbiota composition, could influence bacterial community dynamics.\n4. Conclusions\nThe effects of NNS on intestinal \ufb02ora composition have been a research topic since\nthe late 1980s [ 126\u2013129]. Different effects of NNS on the metabolism of the gut microbiota\nhave been described until now. Although a negligible amount of ingested NNS can reach\nthe intestine, few studies here reported indicate that the gut microbiota can metabolize\nthem by producing a variety of biological effects summarized in Figure 4. NNS can\nbe used as a carbon source by some strains of gut bacteria, leading to changes in their\nmetabolic activity and modulating the production of SCFAs [ 70,72]. These compounds,\nsuch as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, have an impact on glucose metabolism and\nhost metabolism and exert an anti-in\ufb02ammatory effect [ 130\u2013132]. Increasing in\ufb02ammation\nin the gut could contribute to various diseases such as IBD. The immune function of the\nhost could also be modulated by the ability of NNS to reduce the abundance of some\nbene\ufb01cial gut bacteria, such as Bi\ufb01dobacterium and Lactobacillus [133,134], or to increase\nthe abundance of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium dif\ufb01cile and E. coli , which can\ncause infections and in\ufb02ammation in the gut [ 135,136]. NNS can also alter the expression\nof genes involved in bacterial metabolism, altering the composition and function of the\ngut microbial community. They were also reported to be able to affect the release of gut\nhormones and neurotransmitters, in\ufb02uencing gut motility, nutrient absorption, and the\ncomposition of the gut microbiome, thus inducing alterations in glucose metabolism. Some\nstudies suggested that NNS can induce gut dysbiosis and in\ufb02ammation by increasing levels\nof bile acids [137,138].\nHowever, as indicated by the data summarized in this paper, numerous con\ufb02icting\nresults have been reported indicating that the topic still needs to be debated. Pre-clinical\nstudies conducted mainly on rodents have focused on the number of intestinal total anaer-\nobic and aerobic bacteria, bacterial diversity, and the F/B ratio and have investigated\nthe effects of fecal transplantation and the maternal intake of NNS on offspring. These\ncon\ufb02icting results can be explained by a wide range of reasons, including differences in the\nadministration of NNS to animals, the metabolism of NNS in animal species and humans,\nand the lack of a clear de\ufb01nition of dysbiosis or eubiosis.\nAlthough some human trials have observed a dysbiotic effect of NNS, many ran-\ndomized controlled trials have reported a lack of signi\ufb01cant effects on the gut microbiota\ncomposition after exposure to NNS. The studies reviewed in this paper differed in the\nnumber of subjects involved, their dietary habits, and their lifestyle, all factors relating\nto the baseline composition of gut microbiota and their response to NNS. Therefore, it is\nstill hard to de\ufb01ne precisely whether the use of NNS causes signi\ufb01cant changes in the gut\nmicrobiota, as so much con\ufb02icting information has been published. On the whole, studies\ninvestigating the impact of NNS on the gut microbiota conclude that while the commu-Nutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 23 of 29\nnity may be altered in response to NNS, there are differences across studies complicating\nspeci\ufb01c interpretations and direct comparisons while raising questions about a potential\nmechanism of action behind these responses.\nNutrients 2023 , 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW  23 of 31 \n \n 4. Conclusions  \nThe effects of NNS on intestinal flora composition have been a research topic since \nthe late 1980s [126\u2013129].

These compounds, such as \nacetate, propionate, and butyrate, have an impact on glucose metab olism and host metab-\nolism and exert an anti -inflammatory effect [130\u2013132]. Increasing inflammation in the gut \ncould contribute to various diseases such as IBD. The immune function of the host could \nalso be modulated by the ability of NNS to reduce the abun dance of some beneficial gut \nbacteria, such as Bifidobacterium  and Lactobacillus  [133,134], or to increase the abundance \nof pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile  and E. coli, which can cause infections \nand inflammation in the gut [135,136]. NN S can also alter the expression of genes involved \nin bacterial metabolism, altering the composition and function of the gut microbial com-\nmunity. They were also reported to be able to affect the release of gut hormones and neu-\nrotransmitters, influencing gut  motility, nutrient absorption, and the composition of the \ngut microbiome , thus inducing alterations in glucose metabolism.

Overview of some of the documented effects of NNS in both humans and the gut microbiota\nmetabolism. Created with BioRender.com.\nThe discrepant results reported in this review also raise questions about the relevance\nof individual nutrients, such as NNS, to microbiota changes. Many lifestyle factors, espe-\ncially negative health-related behaviors (i.e., smoking, alcohol addiction, unhealthy eating\nhabits) and reduced access to medical and dental care, impact the microbiome [ 18,39,40].\nFurthermore, both the environment we live in and the built environment, including struc-\ntures built by humans such as homes, workplaces, schools, and vehicles, can in\ufb02uence the\ncomposition of the gut microbiome [ 139]. It is, therefore, clear that the ingestion of NNS is\nonly one of the multiple factors that can have a signi\ufb01cant impact on the composition and\nvariety of the microbiota. Further studies are needed to establish whether the consumption\nof NNS alone, at doses permitted by regulatory agencies, is the most relevant factor.\n5. Future Directions\nNew efforts are needed to conduct pre-clinical and clinical well-designed studies that\nare aimed at establishing the potential dysbiotic effects of NNS. In particular, long-term,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials with appropriate doses and adequate\nsubject sizes are required to assess the impact of NNS on intestinal microbiota and how\nthey might affect major outcomes related to chronic diseases. Despite these previously\nunappreciated impacts of NNS, their value must be considered in relation to their role in\nlimiting caloric intake as alternatives to sugar, supporting oral hygiene, and reducing risk\nfactors for the development of caries. The value of NNS to efforts limiting the global health\nburden of obesity and obesity-related disease may well outweigh their potential effects on\nthe human gut microbiota.\nThe impact of NNS on the intestinal microbiota is made even more complex by recent data\nsuggesting that, thanks to their effects on bacterial cell membranes and cellular permeability ,\nthey could contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance [ 140,141]. Aspartame, acesulfame-K,Nutrients 2023 ,15, 1869 24 of 29\nsucralose, and saccharin, at concentrations corresponding to the ADI established by the FDA\nfor an individual with a body weight of 60 kg and lower than the threshold concentrations\nregulated by the Codex General Standard for Food Additives, resulted in them being able\nto promote the intra-and inter-genus spread between bacteria of antibiotic resistance genes\nin a dose-dependent manner [ 140,141]. In addition, aspartame, acesulfame-K, and sucralose,\nbut not saccharin, raised mRNA expression levels of genes that are essential for replicating\nthe resistant genes and their transfer from the donor to the recipient bacteria [ 140,141]. These\nfindings suggest that the four most commonly used sweeteners might exert a potential\nantibiotic-like effect contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, it is important\nto underline that these data were obtained in vitro , in simplified experimental conditions,\nwithout reproducing the complex physiological situation occurring in vivo , and their relevance\nshould be demonstrated by additional experiments.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.C., L.D. and M.S.; methodology, A.C.; writing\u2014original\ndraft preparation, L.D. and A.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, L.D. and M.S.; funding acquisition,\nL.D. and M.S.

Some research indicates NNS can alter the gut microbiota and potentially impact human health, while others show no significant changes. Preclinical studies mainly focus on animal models, while human trials vary in design and outcomes. Discrepancies may be due to factors like NNS doses, study design, and individual variability. The impact of NNS remains debated and requires further investigation.\n\n# AUTHORS\nAndrea Conz, Mario Salmona, and Luisa Diomede.\n\n# AUTHOR ORGANIZATIONS\nDepartment of Molecular Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milano, Italy.\n\n# FINDINGS\n- NNS consumption can potentially alter the composition of gut microbiota in some pre-clinical and clinical studies.\n- Saccharin and sucralose may induce gut dysbiosis and affect the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio associated with various diseases.\n- Acesulfame-K may affect body weight, alter beneficial gut bacteria, and cause gender-specific changes in microbiota composition in animal models.\n- Variable human responses to saccharin ingestion and potential changes in glucose metabolism are observed.\n- Conlicting results across studies with no unanimous consensus on NNS' long-term health effects and impact on microbiota.\n\n# STUDY DETAILS\nStudies range from pre-clinical animal models to randomized controlled human trials, varying in size, duration, methods, and types of NNS examined (aspartame, acesulfame-K, sucralose, saccharin).\n\n# STUDY QUALITY\n\n### Biochemical Relevance\n- Studies provide mixed evidence on NNS' contribution to understanding metabolic pathways related to gut microbiota.\n\n### Sample Size and Population\n- Varies widely; inconsistencies in sample size may contribute to conflicting results.\n\n### Methodological Rigor\n- Experimental designs vary, with some studies lacking appropriate controls or blinding, and others being well-controlled.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n- Appropriate statistical methods used, but varied between studies.\n\n### Reproducibility\n- Most studies provide sufficient detail for replication, but the complex interplay between diet, microbiota, and health complicates reproducibility.\n\n### Interpretation Consistency\n- Conclusions on NNS\u2019 impact on microbiota and health are inconsistent across studies.\n\n### Integration in Biochemical Research\n- NNS research integrates variable aspects of biochemical research on gut microbiota and metabolic health.\n\n# RELEVANCE RATING\nGiven the mixed findings and methodological differences among the studies, the overall relevance to achieving over 80% in the dissertation \"Research Avenues for Investigating Potential Links Between Non-nutritive Sweeteners and Metabolic Health Outcomes\" is rated as a 5 out of 10 in terms of importance and clarity."}

AI launched the full training run of GPT 5 I've gone through every Source I can find to bring you the most reliable information on what that means including possibly every public comment on the topic from open aai an exclusive interview with a hardware CEO and tons of my own analysis plus I'm going to find time to throw in a practical tip that you can use literally every time you open gbt and a bonus darly discovery that I really enjoy but let's start with these two tweets and the first clue that the fullscale gp5 is being trained comes from the president and co-founder of open AI Greg Brockman now first a little bit of context open aai typically trains smaller models of about a thousandth the size before they do a full training run they then gather insights from these smaller models before doing the full training run so that's the backdrop to open AI in brockman's words scientifically predicting and understanding the resulting systems that being done what they're now building is maximally harnessing all their Computing resources they're Gathering all of their ideas together and scaling Beyond precedent translated they are training their biggest model yet we'll get to parameters data and capabilities in a moment but first what's this other tweet this comes from Jason way a top open AI researcher a few hours after brockman's tweet he said there's no adrenaline rush like launching a massive GPU training and this got plenty of salutes in the reply from other open AI employees now for context this does not mean that we're imminently going to get GPT 5 GPT 4 took around 3 months to train and then there was the safety testing I'm actually going to end this video with my exact prediction of when I think they're going to release GPT 5 but first here is a little bit more supporting evidence that they are currently training GPT 5 openai updated their blog to say that applications for the red teaming Network have closed and that those red teamers would know about the status of their applications by the end of last year what that means is that the red teamers are now in place to start safety testing the new model now you might say what's the point of having those red teamers in place if it's still going to be training for 2 to 3 months well before a model is fully trained it goes through various checkpoints think of them a bit like a video game save what that also means is that in effect open AI will have a GPT 4.2 before they have a gp5 indeed Greg Brockman going back to April of last year said that it might be one of those checkpoints that open AI released first he said that it's easy to create a Continuum of incrementally better AIS such as by deploying subsequent checkpoints of a given training run and he explicitly contrasted that approach and said it would be very unlike our historical approach of infrequent major model upgrades but remember that even before those checkpoints open AI would have already gotten a glimpse of GPT 5's capabilities from those smaller earlier versions of the model indeed samman back in November said that he was privileged to be in the room when they push back the veil of ignorance I'm super excited uh I can't imagine anything more exciting to work on and on a personal note like four times now in the history of open ey the the most recent time was just in the last couple coup weeks I've gotten to be in the room um when we sort of like push the front the sort of the veil of ignorance back and the front tier of Discovery forward and getting to do that is like the professional honor of a lifetime it all points to open AI in November and December having trained those smaller versions of GPC 5 again with the purpose of scientifically predicting and understanding the resulting GPT 5 system so they know it's going to be good but just how good and how big and what are these new or old ideas that they're going to incorporate well one thing that seems almost certain is that they're going to incorporate a way to let GPT 5 think for longer in other words it's going to lay out its reasoning steps before solving a challenge and have each of those reasoning steps checked internally or externally here's samman a few days ago at Davos what it means to verify or understand what's going on is going to be a little bit different than people think right now uh I actually can't look in your brain and look at the 100 trillion synapses uh and try to understand what's happening in each one and say okay I really understand why he's thinking what he's thinking you're not a black box to me um but what I can ask you to do is explain to me your reasoning I can say you know you think this thing why and you can explain first this then this then there's this conclusion then that one and then there's this and I can decide if that sounds reasonable to me or not and I think our AI systems will also be able to do the same thing they will be able to explain to us in natural language the steps from concl from A to B and we can decide whether we think those are good steps and a few days before that samman told Bill Gates that that might involve asking GPT 4 or GPT 5 the same question 10,000 times you know when you look at the next two years what what do you think some of the the key Milestones will be multimodality will definitely be important weed speech in speech out speech in speech out images eventually video clearly people really want that we launched images and audio and it had a much stronger response than we expected we'll be able to push that much further but maybe the most important areas of progress will be around reasoning ability right now gp4 can reason in only extremely limited ways and also reliability if you ask gp4 most questions 10,000 times one of those 10,000 is probably pretty good but it doesn't always know which which one and you'd like to get the best response of 10,000 each time that increase in reliability will be important and at this point Watchers of my channel will know exactly what he's referring to both of those approaches checking your reasoning steps and sampling up to 10,000 times are incorporated into open ai's let's verify step-by-step paper now I'm not going to dive into the details of let's verify in this video cuz I've got at least two previous videos on the topic but notice in the paper how many times they sample GPT 4 the chart shows what happens when you sample the model over a thousand times and pick out the best responses and notice something about this process supervised way of doing things the results are continuing to go up I can't resist showing you a quick example of the reasoning steps broken down into separate lines and essentially a verifier looking in and checking which steps are accurate or inacurate the answers for whom each step in the reasoning process got a thumbs up were the ones submitted and the results were dramatic essentially this process of sampling the model thousands of times and taking the answer that had the highest rated reasoning steps doubled the performance in mathematics and no this didn't just work for mathematics it had dramatic results across the stem fields and remember this was using GPT 4 as a base model not GPT 5 and it was only 2,000 samples not 10,000 like samman talked about so this is the evidence I would present to someone who said that llms have PE if open AI can incorporate through parallelization a way to get the model to submit and analyze 10,000 responses the results could be truly dramatic indeed the let's verify paper from openai repeatedly cited this earlier deep mine paper on solving math problems with process-based feedback and for coding we know Alpha code 2 from Google deepmind use Mass sampling approach to get an 87th percentile score on a coding contest in other words it beat 87% of participants in this code forces coding challenge for context the gp4 that we got scored around the fifth percentile a score of 400 in the code forces challenge these numbers are a little out of date but Alpha code 2 would have scored around here expert or candidate Master Level or to just translate everything if they find a way to let gp5 think it could be night and day in terms of performance for coding mathematics and stem but just how big will gp5 be that's doing all of this parallel thinking well for AI insiders I interviewed Gavin Uberti the CEO and co-founder of etched AI which I've also talked about on this channel he is a 21-year-old Dropout from Harvard University and on his LinkedIn profile it says he's building the hardware for superintelligence in the interview he guessed that GPT 5 would have around 10 times the parameter count of GPT 4 according to leaks GPT 4 has around 1.5 to 1.8 trillion parameters but just quickly what did he mean when he said that he expects that to come from a combination of a larger embedding Dimension more layers and double the number of experts well think of the embedding Dimension as being about how granular the training can be about each token and its context a bigger embedding Dimension means more granularity and Nuance about each token and doubling the number of layers allows a model to develop deeper pattern recognition it allows it to see more complex pattern within patterns within patterns more highlights from that interview will be coming on AI Insiders on patreon in the coming weeks but during this video on GPT 5 I promised you two interludes one focused on Dar 3 and one a practical tip for using chat anytime well here is the first of those two interludes focused on a particular Quirk of Dar 3 I say that but this trick also works for Mid Journey now many of you might have noticed a trend on Tik Tok Reddit Twitter and and YouTube shorts where people post an image and then make it progressively more intense let's say well here's something arguably even more quirky I got the original idea from Peter werf for on Twitter and decided to make it more intense but first I asked draw an image of a London scene but don't use lampost in the image and lo and behold we get dozens of lampost I mean in this one we have a lampost coming down from the sky and what does gp4 say in analyzing these it says that these are two images of a London Street Scene without lampost so then I said now make these images with even fewer lampost stripping any lampost references completely and here were the results as you can see on the right there's barely a lampos in sight and as GPT 4 says these images were created with complete omission of any lampost references then I said delete absolutely everything that pertains to a lampost and I don't know about you but I can't see any lampost left and finally I said take this to the Max and give me an image that someone could not picture a lampost existing within even in their wildest imagination now I think it's pretty cute that the lampost persisted throughout these images and I suspect that the deeper reason is that the caption training that Dar 3 got didn't have many examples of a mission they used web captions and synthetic captions but I doubt there were many examples of people saying this image does not contain X but speaking of modality the first thing they want to fix apparently for GPT 5 is the real time nature of the voice interaction at the moment there is quite a bit of time to First token latency in other words it takes a bit too long to reply here's Sam Alman speaking last week I think there's all sorts of the current stuff that people complain about like the voice is too slow and you know it's not real time and that'll get better this year I I think where we're headed and then I'll talk about this year is we're headed towards the way you use a computers to talk to it the operating system of of a computer in some sense is is close to this idea that you're like working inside of a chat experience when he mentioned using an llm as an operating system he was drawing on Andre Kathy's Vision I've talked about it before but notice at the top that it's video In and Out audio in and out and it's not like open AI are hiding it they want as much text image audio and video data as they can get their hands on they also want what I'm going to call reasoning data data that expresses human intention they call it now I didn't notice that phrase at the time of this blog post in November but it fits in clearly with what I was saying earlier about let's verify think about it how would you make a model agentic able to solve more complex challenges well if gbt 5 gets loads of data about people laying out plans full of human intention gbt 5 could learn to imitate those schemes and plans and maybe have a verifier internally or externally judging those reasoning steps now as for the question of whether those reasoning steps Faithfully represent what the model is internally calculating that will have to be for another day this paper from anthropic back in July said that as models become larger and more capable they actually produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study that doesn't mean getting the answer wrong more often it means outputting reasoning steps that don't actually reflect what it's internally calculating so GPT 5 may end up being an excellent productivity assistant while still being somewhat inscrutable on a deeper level just quickly before we leave data I think there's one thing that we can safely say which is that there will be much more multilingual data in Gypsy 5 training set open AI have formed so many data Partnerships including with people like the Icelandic government and there are so many more multilingual data sets being open-sourced that I think it's almost inevitable that there will be a dramatic forward step in GPT 5's multilingual abilities partly this is a safety thing too with open AI wanting its red teamers to be fluent in more than one language models are notorious iously easier to jailbreak in different languages and it looks like open AI are working hard on that front but there is one language that I bet you didn't know gp4 can already speak and that's the language of according to this fascinating paper from Tokyo GPT 4 can almost perfectly handle unnatural scrambled text now you might already know that humans have this ability if the first and last letter of a word is the same you can often still recognize the word but GPT 4 and obviously GPT 5 will be able to go a step further even if the first and last letter are different if a word is completely scrambled it can recover the sentence I tested it out and indeed it works just look at how utterly garbled this sentence is for me and you that would be almost complete gobble but gp4 was able to recognize what I'm saying so that is the Practical tip that I also wanted to give you in this video If you have a quick request of gpc4 don't bother going back and spending 30 seconds correcting all your typos trust me I've been guilty of this in the past because I love perfect English but if you have a lesser or two out of place don't worry it will understand to be honest if it can unscramble this it can understand your typo of the word there you're missing comma and all the rest of it so save yourself 30 seconds and don't even bother correcting your typos but now it's time for me to finally give my prediction for when gpc5 is going to be released for the last few weeks I've honestly thought it would be around September of this year but now I think it will be toward the end of November of 2024 and no that's not just because that would be the 2-year anniversary of the release of chat GPT the original version first let me clarify that I don't think they will release the full capabilities of GPT 5 on the first go as mentioned I think they'll release different checkpoints different functionalities as we head into 2025 but what explains the delay from now when they're training it all the way to November M well first of all as mentioned it does take a few months to train a model the size of GPC 5 yes they might be able to use say 100,000 h100 gpus from Nvidia but training a model has hiccups and of course the model will be much larger but let's say that takes around 2 months that would bring us to the end of March now here's the key Point Sam Alman has boasted many times in the past about how they tested GPT 4 for 6 to 8 months before releasing it it would be pretty awkward for open AI to have even less safety testing for GPT 5 so add 6 months to the end of March and you get to the end of September of course add 8 months and you get to the end of November so why end of November rather than end of September well I think open aai will want to steer clear of what will be an incredibly contentious American election if they release even an alpha version of gpc5 with say video and audio before that election they could come under incred credible Flack as they say on their website they're still working to understand how effective their current tools might be for personalized persuasion that would be stepping into a Minefield in the recent New Hampshire election we already saw rooc calls imitating Joe Biden what a bunch of Maly we know the value of voting Democratic when our votes count it's important that you save your vote for the November election so November 30th as well as being a symbolic date would stay clear of that election you might say what about 2025 but I think the incentives of Mok will prevent them delaying too long in not too long we might be getting the release of Gemini Ultra not to mention Gemini 2 ultra and of course llama 3 from meta announced by Zuckerberg when everyone else has caught up they might feel compelled to release the next model and anthropic might choose a similar time to release Claude 3 here is the CEO of anthropic Dario amade giving his rough predictions for GPT 5 and Claude 3 what do you think happens on the next major training run for l my guess would be you know nothing truly insane happens Say in any training run that that that you know happens in 2024 you know to really invent new science the ability to to cure diseases ability to make to make bio yeah the ability to make bioweapons yeah maybe someday that the Dyson fears the the least impressive of those things I think you know will happen I I would say no sooner than 2025 maybe 2026 um I think we're just going to see in 202 for crisper more commercially applicable versions of the models that exist today like we you know we've seen a few of these generations of jumps I think in 2024 people are certainly going to be surprised like they're going to be surprised at how much better these things have gotten but it's it's not going to quite Bend reality yet of course I have to say at the end of this video that no one truly knows not even open AI what gpc5 will be like as samman recently said until we go train that model gpc5 it's like a fun guessing game for us I can't tell you here's exactly what it's going to do that GPT 4 didn't and here's Greg Brockman with a similar message right that is the biggest theme in the history of AI is that it's full of surprises every time you think you know something you scale it up 10x turns out you knew nothing um and so I think that we as a Humanity as a species are really exploring This Together MH and then we get cryptic messages like this from senior members of open aai Ben new house says he's hiring at openai and we're building what I think could be an industry defining 0o to1 product that leverages the latest and greatest from our upcoming models IE gp5 and two other openai employees replied like this this product will change everything and what they said of course it would be pure speculation to guess what they mean with this so those were my predictions I try to base them on evidence rather than idle speculation I do try not to be lazy like gypt 4 has in the past been accused of being if you like this kind of thing I would invite you to see more exclusive premium content on AI Insiders on patreon but for everyone watching to the end I

prompt to deliver consistent results at scale but what if you can control the prompt to get specific output structure and get a general image and the charts with just one single prompt there are few Advanced proper engineer Frameworks that I found extremely useful but not enough people using it and that's what I want to talk about today the first one I want to talk about is called guidance it is an open source framework initially introduced by Microsoft and got more than 12 000 stars on GitHub fundamentally it is a framework that allow you to program the prompt to get specific output it gives you very specific control of how the final output structure should look like and also allow you to construct The Prompt with for each Loop Define list of candidate answers and even insert if conditions inside your prompts so this allows you to configure the final output very easily to get started you can open Visual Studio code and then we can create a jupyter notebook that we install ipy and B so firstly we will install the guide lens and open AI package and we will import the guidance and then to Guidance the large language model with openai text DaVinci you can also use GPD 3.5 gp4 or even open source model like llama as well but they do have specific syntax you need to follow and the first thing we will try is Define a specific output structure you want so you can create something like prompt template like how you do in launching by creating variable with guidance and inside here you will Define The Prompt template where I would Define one variable with this bubble curly bracket and also another double curly bracket with special term gen the part that you actually want large model to creating so the final output would look something like this when Steve Jobs said without guidance AI would do more harm than good with this it allow you to get a specific structure output and if you want you can even change multiple output together so I can add another one counter argument and let me run this so you can see here the large language model actually generates this two parts and without guidance framework it's actually possible to do manually but it will just require a a lot of manual work and apart from defining the structure you can also restrict the actual output the large energy model going to generate for example I can ask large knowledge model to choose one of the predefined answers instead of creating their own so I can define a list of options here and then create another guidance is the following sentence offensive where I will give an example and ask it to select an answer from the three options I give here I'll give you example is pretty rude your taco tastes like and try to run this so it will follow that specific structure and give me the answer is yes and here I didn't give it any extra prompt about what the answer should be just follow the list of predefined answers I give and if I change this to be something more polite like your tacos taste can be improved and try it again then it will answer no so this is a really powerful way that if we want to restrict down the answers the large language model actually generates in use case like writing email or customer response where you still want to use the reasoning part of the large language model but you already got best practice and the other part I want to talk about is that you can also set up Advanced logic like a if condition for example in the same use case where we asked large language model to classify if the user response is root we can actually create a workflow where if the answer is rude then it will trigger specific typo response if the answer is not root then the system will generate a response like normal the way we will do that is we'll still use a slap and give the response name root and this basically means we will have a variable called root that we can use in other parts of the prop and then we can create a if condition if root is yes which is from the predefined condition we give then a system will say please be polite but and if root is no then a system will generate answer so let's try this okay with this user response your toggle tests are shared the large large model detail it is actually root so it triggers this workflow where a system will say please be polite but if I change to something like your taco tastes too salty it'll be showing the answer is not rude then it actually generate a proper response so this is a way for you to achieve if condition larger in your final output and these are the value costs usage as well for example I probably don't want this part in the middle to be showing in the final output because it's kind of internal logic so I can actually hide this from the final output by creating block to wrap this part with attribution hidden equal to true and if I run this again then the part in the middle will be hidden so this is how you can achieve if condition and I think if condition is probably one of the most powerful use case for guidance those are just a few functions that guidance have and they are actually more things that you can learn from their documentations but with those basic building blocks you can already create very Advanced props for example for the use case when I want light language model to generate emails one problems I always face with is that sometimes I do want to use the reasoning power of large Range model but I want response to be exactly like the best practice that I come up with and I don't want any creativities around them and on the other side I also want to create some if conditions there if this client is very important then book a meeting right away but if it's just general in priority then just response like normal so to achieve their use case I will Define a list of predefined Priority First from low to high and I'll create one blocks at the beginning to let large language model give a priorities and then I will ask large language model to generate the email response and in the end I will hide those two logic blocks and showing the email response is generated and if the priority is high priority then I want to insert this specific message to schedule call with customers right away with my calendar link so that's why I don't want it to be created because if you change the link it won't work so let's try it assume a customer complaint come to my inbox your server is so terrible that I want to refund this is kind of high stake situation that I wanted to schedule call right away so you can see here it actually generate a message also insert the predefined message with my calendar link but if I change to be something more soft like what features does webflow have but Wix don't have then this will show a different message and won't trigger this specific calendar link and on the other side I can also use guidance framework to let large knowledge model generate real-time hard for me with service like quick chart and if you don't know what a quick chart is it's a open API where it allowed me to generate charts in real time by passing on the chart data in a URL if I can get a URL looks something like this then it will generate this chart on the Fly which means if we can get large energy model to turn a natural language query into a data structure like this then we can generate charts in real time and here we will use another function from guidance which is ability to trigger custom functions inside the problem so the way we will do that is I will give the prompt a few short examples so that it will learn if the input is this it should generate Json data like this and once it generates Json data I will use this function pause chart link to put together a URL and displaying markdown so the way I would do that is I would Define this function that will pass on the Json file into a URL linking markdown and then I will Define a few short examples here and then I'll create another Guidance with this prompt you are a world-class data analyst you will generate chart output based on the natural language which in here I have this 4 inch wrapper and I will run this q a pair from the predefined list and once they finish the free of sharp prompts I will insert the actual user query and I'll see large language model to generate chart data and all this logic will be hidden from the final output because I wrap under this block and the final output will be hello here is the charter you want and the result will be calling the customer function I defined above with the variable chart the large language model created which is Json data and once I did that I can try to use this function create a pie chart showing the population of the word by continent it will generate this response and it is in markdown format so if you paste this in a markdown preview you will see this is results a population breakdown by continent chart that generated in real time and if you want I also include a streamlined app where you can visualize and test those three dots better and with the same shred of salt you can also use large language model to generate image straight away with service like pollinations and if you don't know what pollination is it's also another open API they allow you to create an AI image on the Fly for example I can do image.pollination.ai prompt a cute girl and this will generate this image right away and this allows us to build a use case like if I give a story idea it can generate a whole story as well as a proper illustration so I can do something similar where I will have a logic block to ask large language model to generate story based on my story idea and then have another block to generate the image linking markdown based on the story and in the end I'll put them together and if I try this again it will generate a proper story from a single prompt and also generate proper illustration as well so this is a guidance framework I think it's very powerful even though it is still a bit buggy and the lack of documentation but it is quite powerful once I get it I have attached all those example codes I show you here in the description below so feel free to try it out even though guidance is a very powerful framework but at the end of the day it will be still the iterative process you will still need to spend a top time fine tuning and iterating your prompts to get the best results but there are a few other community and open source projects that I think can really speed up the process here one of them is flow GPT so flow GPT is one of the biggest prompt library and probably one of the biggest prompt engineering community as well I always go up to flow GPT every time when I try to build some specific prompts because it's a wide range of collections from marketings programming so for example if I want to create a prompt for SEO blocks I can just come here see what are the prompts that Community has voted most and I can click on that take a look about the problems that other people create so this provides me a much better starting point and I can also get a preview about what the readouts will be this is where I learned a lot of tactics here for example I actually learned about permissions from The Prompt here because someone actually built a full text-based adventure with just one single prop which is super impressive so I definitely recommend to use this as a prompt Discovery tool at the rare beginning and on the outside there's also another project called GPT prompt engineer and the concept is pretty simple it basically asks GPD to generate prompt and also use GPT to evaluate and test the quality of prompts so it refers to use gpd4 to generate a set of prompts based on the goal you give it for example I can use GPT prompt engineer to generate prompt for writing SEO blog posts and it will use gpd4 to generate 4 or 10 different prompts and then it will start using gbd4 as evaluation machine to do the testing it was starting doing 20 or 30 rounds of testing across prompts and figure out which one is the best to be honest from my experience the prompts generated by GPD is actually not as good as the one set you will come up by yourself so I won't rely purely on gpe to generate bombs autonomously however the part I found is most value is actually this evaluation framework because normally I will come up with two or three different variations between the prompts and I want to figure out which one gonna performs best at scale they're actually someone built a front end based on this GPD prompt engineer called prompts Royal where you can basically get GPT to generate a prompt and do the testing and once it finished it will show you the evaluation results between different prompts and in the end give you a score so even though I don't really like the default prompts that GPT generated but I often use this as a way to evaluate different prompts I generated so I can manually paste in two or three different prompts that I created and use this platform to evaluate which one is better so those are a few learnings I want to share with you about problem engineer if you know more interesting tactics and Frameworks please comment below and let me know if you enjoyed this content please consider give me subscribe I'll
