want to learn AI so usually when you're trying to learn something new it look something like a straight line first you learn calculus linear algebra probability statistics programming machine learning deep learning Etc so kind of like that progression don't get me wrong you do need to learn these things eventually but my problem is that I can't even get past one of these subjects without getting really bored getting stuck and giving up hey no hate these are amazing resources so what if it's not the resources themselves that's the problem but the way that we use them is there a way that we can learn Ai and not give up introducing the renon method or if for some strange reason you don't like Naruto the concentric Circle method how does it work so in the middle of the renegon you have the thing that you want to learn which is AI we go from the middle and we go outwards so for the small circle we just need to learn the basics of AI such as a high level of how machine Learning Works how large language models work but most importantly how do you use these models with python don't worry I'll go into a lot more detail about exactly what you need to learn and recommend some resources later but the point is that you learn just enough so that you're able to build a really cool AI thing like this study tool or personal AI assistant as soon as possible like I'm saying realistically 1 month if you have zero coding experience and a week or two if you have some intermediate experience in Python and then after you do this we take this excitement and satisfaction of building this really cool thing and we use that as motivation to go into the next layer of the circle we dive a little bit deeper into what exactly is machine learning how does it work as some of the math surrounding it which would allow us to then build something else that is really cool and then use that as motivation to expand again into the next level of the circle so you kind of just repeat this cycle so that you're learning more and more advanced things and also getting to apply them until you become quite Advent and be able to tr truly understand AI models like how chat GPT works and even build your own so what is machine learning let's start with a hot dog do pizza yes do pizza that's that's it it only does hot dogs no and a naha dog so that was an example of machine learning machine learning is a way for computers to learn and make decisions by themselves by studying a recognizing patterns in data there are many different types of machine learning models and this one specifically is called a CNS a convolutional neuron Network by the way I might be throwing some terminology here and there but don't worry about remembering things and understanding I'm just putting these here so as you're learning you kind of go like oh like she talked about this like I'm learning this right now I'll be explaining more about how these work later in the video as well but first let's talk about how Jimmy was able to build this hot dog not hot dog model so first you have your little baby model that has not seen the world yet and you got to start feeding it images about hot dogs but you also have to show it pictures of not hot dogs you also want to show it some tricky cases like this dog that looks like a hot dog and this hot dog sausage doesn't have a bun I don't know if that's still considered a hot dog is that actually a hot dog though anyways you do this many many times and it starts to learn what is considered a hot dog and what is not considered a hot dog or more specifically what are the features that make it more hot dog like and what are the features that make it less likely to be a hot dog for example if it sees this cylindrical reddish thing it makes a note that this is an increased likelihood of that being a hot dog and it sees this white stuff around this red thing and again it will make a note that there's an increase in a likelihood of being this hot dog it will then come up a score with its prediction of How likely it is a hot dog but for example if it sees this triangular looking thing it goes like huh triangles are not hot dog like so it decreases the likelihood of that being a hot dog and so on and so forth until it gets better and better at predicting whether it's a hot dog or not a hot dog now let's take a look at Chachi BT over here which is also a machine learning model except in this case the data we're feeding it is a bunch of text Data like the entire internet's Text data and it uses his data to predict the next words in a sentence it's based upon its previous words for example if you have the words I am and the word sleeping it'll give a likelihood of that being the next word which is probably relatively high but there can also

somehow magically is able to chain these together to form coherent sentences isn't that crazy like thinking about how it actually works of course I'm simplifying things a little bit here for now though what's very exciting is that you can actually use these AI models pretty easy easily to start building your own AI products say like this AI personal assistant that's able to schedule your life and stuff and by easily I mean if you have zero knowledge about coding it'll probably take you about a month or if you have some intermediate level of coding it'll take you like less than a week or two what you need to learn first is the basics of python variables data types if statements Loops objectoriented programming and apis which stands for application programming interfaces and it's for interacting with other people's software I'm also going to give you some suggestions for resources brilliant has a super beginner friendly course which is super interactive which is great for people with very short attention spans cuz you can like you know do the little dios and click things and things pop up you can get started with brilliant for free they also are the sponsor of today's video If you prefer video learning there is this really good introduction to python from free code camp and if you're into text or reading textbooks so me personally I'm not that into textbooks because it makes me really bored easily but I have heard that this book automate the boring stuff is a really good introduction I want you to especially focus on understanding apis and how to use them because that's how we're going to be able to use these AI models that other people made next we're going to learn the very Basics about large language models which are the AI models that power chat Bots like chat gbt brilliant also has a crash course on large language models which is super beginner friendly like you don't even need to know how to code but if you're into videos this is a 1-hour introduction to large language models by Andre karthy who is an expert in this field next up we're going to do this course on prompt engineering for developers this course is only an hour long and is completely free from deeplearning.ai but seriously this is such a good course in starting to build AI products using open AI apis it teaches you prompt engineering en able to interact with AI models and how to connect and use the API to access the models all right at this point you have the basics of building AI products you can use open AI apis in order to build chat Bots and personal assistance you can also generate images from Models like do also link some more apis that you can use to generate text to video and other cool things you can do also link some examples of projects that you can build Link description you now know how to use AI models through apis but you still don't really know how they work or how to make your own to be able to do that it's kind of like building the foundations of the building you need to lay a very solid foundation first by getting a better understanding of machine learning but before we can dive into the machine learning algorithms themselves we still need to take a step back and break it down into its sub fields of fundamental mathematics statistics and programming specifically in Python what you need to learn one at this intermediate level of python you need to start learning more modules that are related to data manipulation because you need to use data in order to teach your machine learning model stuff so we need to learn the modules of numpy pandas matpa live for data visualization and pyit learn for building machine learning models there are so many great tutorials and courses out there and I'll link them below free code Camp is probably my favorite resource and if you're into books python for data analysis I've heard is very good now math these scary stuff A lot of people are intimidated by math I am also intimidated by math math so the good news is that you don't need to learn that much of math you don't need to sit there and learn how to do like derivatives by hand you just need to understand like the concept of calculus the contract of what a matrix is for linear algebra how to use probability to determine the likelihood of something that's about to happen these are the foundations of machine learning models for my short attention span friends especially I feel like for math math is like especially challenging because it's it can be so boring brilliant is nice and interactive and it gives examples of things so I recommend the coures calculus fundamentals introduction to linear algebra and introduction to probability you can also take this math for ML specialization free on corsera if you want to dive a little bit deeper next up statistics you got to know things like descriptive statistics inferential statistics hypothesis testing Central limit theorem distributions confidence intervals it sounds like a lot but it's pretty much just first year statistics in college again brilliant is how I personally brushed up and learned more about statistics but I also love supplementing with my",

math don't be afraid of neur networks they're not scary if you want something more thorough there's a Standford course on corsera called introduction to statistics by the way a pro tip especially for subjects like math that are kind of like conceptual and hard to understand using chat PT as a personal tutor is literally a game changer it can help explain difficult Concepts and give analogies for things uh where you can like use it to dive deeper into stuff so I'm not going to go into too much detail about how to do that because I already made a video which I'll link over here talking about how to use CH PT as a learning tool highly recommend all right all right now we have truly laid a very solid foundation and we can now dive into machine learning yay machine learning as a field is very very large and there's a lot of different aspects of it so I only want you to focus on understanding the categories of different algorithms and some of the example algorithms out there stuff like regressions K means clustering decision trees Etc and understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning Josh starmer is absolutely my go-to for machine learning content I give Josh full credit for me actually graduating my Master's Degree because I took with this really hard machine learning course and yeah like I would not have graduated without him if you wanted something a little bit more thorough there's also the Stanford and deeplearning.ai course called machine learning specialization all right we' have expanded into the next [Music] Circle neurons are cells in your brain that form a network so that you're able to think and do stuff now ai is modeled after our brains we have these nodes that represent neurons which create what we call artificial neuron networks if you feed these neuron networks data it's able to start learning by itself kind of like when a baby is first born it doesn't really like have anything in its brain but as it starts having more experiences collecting more data it's able to start learning by itself now if you start stacking layers and layers of these neurons together things start getting really interesting and you can create models that are capable of doing incredible tasks this is called Deep learning cuz you got a lot of layers stack together and it's like very deep it's an advanced subfield of machine learning the hot dog no hot dog am model is a model that uses deep learning specifically in the field of computer vision and the AI models that powers chat Bots like chat gbt are called large language models they also use deep learning in the field of natural language processing okay so at this point we're another layer deep and learning about deep learning deep learning layer deep and learning about specializations like computer vision and large language models some recommended resources Brilliance introduction in neuron Network covers the basics and the artificial neuron Network course goes into deep learning again Josh sarmer is just is the best and if you want to go a little bit deeper there's a corsera specialization in deep learning now at this point you can also start branching out into different sub Fields like for example you're interested in hot dogs and not hot dogs you can dive deeper into computer vision and here's also a free corsera specialization on it or if you're interested in large language models and things like that you can dive deeper into natural language processing here's another specialization of corsera a final quick tip okay I do know I give a lot of different resources here but that's mostly just to give you guys a variety based upon what kind of learning style you have do not I repeat do not try to go through all the different resources and try to like learn every single little thing and get like really obsessed with everything just choose one of these resources they're all amazing go through it and then start building your own projects you can build your own neuro networks contribute towards open source AI models and fine-tune other people's models now I want to talk a little bit more about the sponsor of today's video brilliant thank you brilliant I've already mentioned them a few times especially for short attention span friends because they're so interactive brilliant actually only specializ izes and stem subjects so that they're able to make the best courses to teach these subjects I personally love using brilliant whenever I want to learn new things and brush up on different skills especially the math and stats part I get so bored when I try to just like watch a video or do some courses um so just you know having those like little interactive things helps a lot in my understanding they have Timeless course

can like you know do the little dios and click things and things pop up you can get started with brilliant for free they also are the sponsor of today's video If you prefer video learning there is this really good introduction to python from free code camp and if you're into text or reading textbooks so me personally I'm not that into textbooks because it makes me really bored easily but I have heard that this book automate the boring stuff is a really good introduction I want you to especially focus on understanding apis and how to use them because that's how we're going to be able to use these AI models that other people made next we're going to learn the very Basics about large language models which are the AI models that power chat Bots like chat gbt brilliant also has a crash course on large language models which is super beginner friendly like you don't even need to know how to code but if you're into videos this is a 1-hour introduction to large language models by Andre karthy who is an expert in this field next up we're going to do this course on prompt engineering for developers this course is only an hour long and is completely free from deeplearning.ai but seriously this is such a good course in starting to build AI products using open AI apis it teaches you prompt engineering en able to interact with AI models and how to connect and use the API to access the models all right at this point you have the basics of building AI products you can use open AI apis in order to build chat Bots and personal assistance you can also generate images from Models like do also link some more apis that you can use to generate text to video and other cool things you can do also link some examples of projects that you can build Link description you now know how to use AI models through apis but you still don't really know how they work or how to make your own to be able to do that it's kind of like building the foundations of the building you need to lay a very solid foundation first by getting a better understanding of machine learning but before we can dive into the machine learning algorithms themselves we still need to take a step back and break it down into its sub fields of fundamental mathematics statistics and programming specifically in Python what you need to learn one at this intermediate level of python you need to start learning more modules that are related to data manipulation because you need to use data in order to teach your machine learning model stuff so we need to learn the modules of numpy pandas matpa live for data visualization and pyit learn for building machine learning models there are so many great tutorials and courses out there and I'll link them below free code Camp is probably my favorite resource and if you're into books python for data analysis I've heard is very good now math these scary stuff A lot of people are intimidated by math I am also intimidated by math math so the good news is that you don't need to learn that much of math you don't need to sit there and learn how to do like derivatives by hand you just need to understand like the concept of calculus the contract of what a matrix is for linear algebra how to use probability to determine the likelihood of something that's about to happen these are the foundations of machine learning models for my short attention span friends especially I feel like for math math is like especially challenging because it's it can be so boring brilliant is nice and interactive and it gives examples of things so I recommend the coures calculus fundamentals introduction to linear algebra and introduction to probability you can also take this math for ML specialization free on corsera if you want to dive a little bit deeper next up statistics you got to know things like descriptive statistics inferential statistics hypothesis testing Central limit theorem distributions confidence intervals it sounds like a lot but it's pretty much just first year statistics in college again brilliant is how I personally brushed up and learned more about statistics but I also love supplementing with my all-time favorite techdata YouTuber Josh starmer He is very short attention span friendly because how can you possibly get bored of someone singing about math don't be afraid of neur networks they're not scary if you want something more thorough there's a Standford course on corsera called introduction to statistics by the way a pro tip especially for subjects like math that are kind of like conceptual and hard to understand using chat PT as a personal tutor is literally a game changer it can help explain difficult Concepts and give analogies for things uh where you can like use it to dive deeper into stuff so I'm not going to go into too much detail about how to do that because I already made a video which I'll link over here talking about how to use CH PT as a learning tool highly recommend all right all right now we have truly laid a very solid foundation and we can now dive into machine learning yay machine learning as a field is very very large and there's a lot of different aspects of it so I only want you to focus on understanding the categories of different algorithms and some of the example algorithms out there stuff like regressions K means clustering decision trees Etc and understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning Josh starmer is absolutely my go-to for machine learning content I give Josh full credit for me actually graduating my Master's Degree because I took with this really hard machine learning course and yeah like I would not have graduated without him if you wanted something a little bit more thorough there's also the Stanford and deeplearning.ai course called machine learning specialization all right we' have expanded into the next [Music] Circle neurons are cells in your brain that form a network so that you're able to think and do stuff now ai is modeled after our brains we have these nodes that represent neurons which create what we call artificial neuron networks if you feed these neuron networks data it's able to start learning by itself kind of like when a baby is first born it doesn't really like have anything in its brain but as it starts having more experiences collecting more data it's able to start learning by itself now if you start stacking layers and layers of these neurons together things start getting really interesting and you can create models that are capable of doing incredible tasks this is called Deep learning cuz you got a lot of layers stack together and it's like very deep it's an advanced subfield of machine learning the hot dog no hot dog am model is a model that uses deep learning specifically in the field of computer vision and the AI models that powers chat Bots like chat gbt are called large language models they also use deep learning in the field of natural language processing okay so at this point we're another layer deep and learning about deep learning deep learning layer deep and learning about specializations like computer vision and large language models some recommended resources Brilliance introduction in neuron Network covers the basics and the artificial neuron Network course goes into deep learning again Josh sarmer is just is the best and if you want to go a little bit deeper there's a corsera specialization in deep learning now at this point you can also start branching out into different sub Fields like for example you're interested in hot dogs and not hot dogs you can dive deeper into computer vision and here's also a free corsera specialization on it or if you're interested in large language models and things like that you can dive deeper into natural language processing here's another specialization of corsera a final quick tip okay I do know I give a lot of different resources here but that's mostly just to give you guys a variety based upon what kind of learning style you have do not I repeat do not try to go through all the different resources and try to like learn every single little thing and get like really obsessed with everything just choose one of these resources they're all amazing go through it and then start building your own projects you can build your own neuro networks contribute towards open source AI models and fine-tune other people's models now I want to talk a little bit more about the sponsor of today's video brilliant thank you brilliant I've already mentioned them a few times especially for short attention span friends because they're so interactive brilliant actually only specializ izes and stem subjects so that they're able to make the best courses to teach these subjects I personally love using brilliant whenever I want to learn new things and brush up on different skills especially the math and stats part I get so bored when I try to just like watch a video or do some courses um so just you know having those like little interactive things helps a lot in my understanding they have Timeless course offerings like math and stats programming and python as well as new course offerings like the neuron networks courses for the Deep learning and introduction to large language models you can join a millions of people already learning on brilliant I head on over to this link to get started for free also linked in description if you go through my link the first 200 people will get 20% off in annual membership all right that is the end of today's video thank you guys all so much for watching

want to learn AI so usually when you're trying to learn something new it look something like a straight line first you learn calculus linear algebra probability statistics programming machine learning deep learning Etc so kind of like that progression don't get me wrong you do need to learn these things eventually but my problem is that I can't even get past one of these subjects without getting really bored getting stuck and giving up hey no hate these are amazing resources so what if it's not the resources themselves that's the problem but the way that we use them is there a way that we can learn Ai and not give up introducing the renon method or if for some strange reason you don't like Naruto the concentric Circle method how does it work so in the middle of the renegon you have the thing that you want to learn which is AI we go from the middle and we go outwards so for the small circle we just need to learn the basics of AI such as a high level of how machine Learning Works how large language models work but most importantly how do you use these models with python don't worry I'll go into a lot more detail about exactly what you need to learn and recommend some resources later but the point is that you learn just enough so that you're able to build a really cool AI thing like this study tool or personal AI assistant as soon as possible like I'm saying realistically 1 month if you have zero coding experience and a week or two if you have some intermediate experience in Python and then after you do this we take this excitement and satisfaction of building this really cool thing and we use that as motivation to go into the next layer of the circle we dive a little bit deeper into what exactly is machine learning how does it work as some of the math surrounding it which would allow us to then build something else that is really cool and then use that as motivation to expand again into the next level of the circle so you kind of just repeat this cycle so that you're learning more and more advanced things and also getting to apply them until you become quite Advent and be able to tr truly understand AI models like how chat GPT works and even build your own so what is machine learning let's start with a hot dog do pizza yes do pizza that's that's it it only does hot dogs no and a naha dog so that was an example of machine learning machine learning is a way for computers to learn and make decisions by themselves by studying a recognizing patterns in data there are many different types of machine learning models and this one specifically is called a CNS a convolutional neuron Network by the way I might be throwing some terminology here and there but don't worry about remembering things and understanding I'm just putting these here so as you're learning you kind of go like oh like she talked about this like I'm learning this right now I'll be explaining more about how these work later in the video as well but first let's talk about how Jimmy was able to build this hot dog not hot dog model so first you have your little baby model that has not seen the world yet and you got to start feeding it images about hot dogs but you also have to show it pictures of not hot dogs you also want to show it some tricky cases like this dog that looks like a hot dog and this hot dog sausage doesn't have a bun I don't know if that's still considered a hot dog is that actually a hot dog though anyways you do this many many times and it starts to learn what is considered a hot dog and what is not considered a hot dog or more specifically what are the features that make it more hot dog like and what are the features that make it less likely to be a hot dog for example if it sees this cylindrical reddish thing it makes a note that this is an increased likelihood of that being a hot dog and it sees this white stuff around this red thing and again it will make a note that there's an increase in a likelihood of being this hot dog it will then come up a score with its prediction of How likely it is a hot dog but for example if it sees this triangular looking thing it goes like huh triangles are not hot dog like so it decreases the likelihood of that being a hot dog and so on and so forth until it gets better and better at predicting whether it's a hot dog or not a hot dog now let's take a look at Chachi BT over here which is also a machine learning model except in this case the data we're feeding it is a bunch of text Data like the entire internet's Text data and it uses his data to predict the next words in a sentence it's based upon its previous words for example if you have the words I am and the word sleeping it'll give a likelihood of that being the next word which is probably relatively high but there can also be a word like potato which probably has a pretty low likelihood of being an next word so the algorithm picks the word with the highest probability and it somehow magically is able to chain these together to form coherent sentences isn't that crazy like thinking about how it actually works of course I'm simplifying things a little bit here for now though what's very exciting is that you can actually use these AI models pretty easy easily to start building your own AI products say like this AI personal assistant that's able to schedule your life and stuff and by easily I mean if you have zero knowledge about coding it'll probably take you about a month or if you have some intermediate level of coding it'll take you like less than a week or two what you need to learn first is the basics of python variables data types if statements Loops objectoriented programming and apis which stands for application programming interfaces and it's for interacting with other people's software

seriously this is such a good course in starting to build AI products using open AI apis it teaches you prompt engineering en able to interact with AI models and how to connect and use the API to access the models all right at this point you have the basics of building AI products you can use open AI apis in order to build chat Bots and personal assistance you can also generate images from Models like do also link some more apis that you can use to generate text to video and other cool things you can do also link some examples of projects that you can build Link description you now know how to use AI models through apis but you still don't really know how they work or how to make your own to be able to do that it's kind of like building the foundations of the building you need to lay a very solid foundation first by getting a better understanding of machine learning but before we can dive into the machine learning algorithms themselves we still need to take a step back and break it down into its sub fields of fundamental mathematics statistics and programming specifically in Python what you need to learn one at this intermediate level of python you need to start learning more modules that are related to data manipulation because you need to use data in order to teach your machine learning model stuff so we need to learn the modules of numpy pandas matpa live for data visualization and pyit learn for building machine learning models there are so many great tutorials and courses out there and I'll link them below free code Camp is probably my favorite resource and if you're into books python for data analysis I've heard is very good now math these scary stuff A lot of people are intimidated by math I am also intimidated by math math so the good news is that you don't need to learn that much of math you don't need to sit there and learn how to do like derivatives by hand you just need to understand like the concept of calculus the contract of what a matrix is for linear algebra how to use probability to determine the likelihood of something that's about to happen these are the foundations of machine learning models for my short attention span friends especially I feel like for math math is like especially challenging because it's it can be so boring brilliant is nice and interactive and it gives examples of things so I recommend the coures calculus fundamentals introduction to linear algebra and introduction to probability you can also take this math for ML specialization free on corsera if you want to dive a little bit deeper next up statistics you got to know things like descriptive statistics inferential statistics hypothesis testing Central limit theorem distributions confidence intervals it sounds like a lot but it's pretty much just first year statistics in college again brilliant is how I personally brushed up and learned more about statistics but I also love supplementing with my all-time favorite techdata YouTuber Josh starmer He is very short attention span friendly because how can you possibly get bored of someone singing about math don't be afraid of neur networks they're not scary if you want something more thorough there's a Standford course on corsera called introduction to statistics by the way a pro tip especially for subjects like math that are kind of like conceptual and hard to understand using chat PT as a personal tutor is literally a game changer it can help explain difficult Concepts and give analogies for things uh where you can like use it to dive deeper into stuff so I'm not going to go into too much detail about how to do that because I already made a video which I'll link over here talking about how to use CH PT as a learning tool highly recommend all right all right now we have truly laid a very solid foundation and we can now dive into machine learning yay machine learning as a field is very very large and there's a lot of different aspects of it so I only want you to focus on understanding the categories of different algorithms and some of the example algorithms out there stuff like regressions K means clustering decision trees Etc and understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning Josh starmer is absolutely my go-to for machine learning content I give Josh full credit for me actually graduating my Master's Degree because I took with this really hard machine learning course and yeah like I would not have graduated without him if you wanted something a little bit more thorough there's also the Stanford and deeplearning.ai course called machine learning specialization all right we' have expanded into the next [Music] Circle neurons are cells in your brain that form a network so that you're able to think and do stuff now ai is modeled after our brains we have these nodes that represent neurons which create what we call artificial neuron networks if you feed these neuron networks data it's able to start learning by itself kind of like when a baby is first born it doesn't really like have anything in its brain but as it starts having more experiences collecting more data it's able to start learning by itself now if you start stacking layers and layers of these neurons together things start getting really interesting and you can create models that are capable of doing incredible tasks this is called Deep learning cuz you got a lot of layers stack together and it's like very deep it's an advanced subfield of machine learning the hot dog no hot dog am model is a model that uses deep learning specifically in the field of computer vision and the AI models that powers chat Bots like chat gbt are called large language models they also use deep learning in the field of natural language processing okay so at this point we're another layer deep and learning about deep learning deep learning layer deep and learning about specializations like computer vision and large language models some recommended resources Brilliance introduction in neuron Network covers the basics and the artificial neuron Network course goes into deep learning again Josh sarmer is just is the best and if you want to go a little bit deeper there's a corsera specialization in deep learning now at this point you can also start branching out into different sub Fields like for example you're interested in hot dogs and not hot dogs you can dive deeper into computer vision and here's also a free corsera specialization on it or if you're interested in large language models and things like that you can dive deeper into natural language processing here's another specialization of corsera a final quick tip okay I do know I give a lot of different resources here but that's mostly just to give you guys a variety based upon what kind of learning style you have do not I repeat do not try to go through all the different resources and try to like learn every single little thing and get like really obsessed with everything just choose one of these resources they're all amazing go through it and then start building your own projects you can build your own neuro networks contribute towards open source AI models and fine-tune other people's models now I want to talk a little bit more about the sponsor of today's video brilliant thank you brilliant I've already mentioned them a few times especially for short attention span friends because they're so interactive brilliant actually only specializ izes and stem subjects so that they're able to make the best courses to teach these subjects I personally love using brilliant whenever I want to learn new things and brush up on different skills especially the math and stats part I get so bored when I try to just like watch a video or do some courses um so just you know having those like little interactive things helps a lot in my understanding they have Timeless course offerings like math and stats programming and python as well as new course offerings like the neuron networks courses for the Deep learning and introduction to large language models you can join a millions of people already learning on brilliant I head on over to this link to get started for

want to learn AI so usually when you're trying to learn something new it look something like a straight line first you learn calculus linear algebra probability statistics programming machine learning deep learning Etc so kind of like that progression don't get me wrong you do need to learn these things eventually but my problem is that I can't even get past one of these subjects without getting really bored getting stuck and giving up hey no hate these are amazing resources so what if it's not the resources themselves that's the problem but the way that we use them is there a way that we can learn Ai and not give up introducing the renon method or if for some strange reason you don't like Naruto the concentric Circle method how does it work so in the middle of the renegon you have the thing that you want to learn which is AI we go from the middle and we go outwards so for the small circle we just need to learn the basics of AI such as a high level of how machine Learning Works how large language models work but most importantly how do you use these models with python don't worry I'll go into a lot more detail about exactly what you need to learn and recommend some resources later but the point is that you learn just enough so that you're able to build a really cool AI thing like this study tool or personal AI assistant as soon as possible like I'm saying realistically 1 month if you have zero coding experience and a week or two if you have some intermediate experience in Python and then after you do this we take this excitement and satisfaction of building this really cool thing and we use that as motivation to go into the next layer of the circle we dive a little bit deeper into what exactly is machine learning how does it work as some of the math surrounding it which would allow us to then build something else that is really cool and then use that as motivation to expand again into the next level of the circle so you kind of just repeat this cycle so that you're learning more and more advanced things and also getting to apply them until you become quite Advent and be able to tr truly understand AI models like how chat GPT works and even build your own so what is machine learning let's start with a hot dog do pizza yes do pizza that's that's it it only does hot dogs no and a naha dog so that was an example of machine learning machine learning is a way for computers to learn and make decisions by themselves by studying a recognizing patterns in data there are many different types of machine learning models and this one specifically is called a CNS a convolutional neuron Network by the way I might be throwing some terminology here and there but don't worry about remembering things and understanding I'm just putting these here so as you're learning you kind of go like oh like she talked about this like I'm learning this right now I'll be explaining more about how these work later in the video as well but first let's talk about how Jimmy was able to build this hot dog not hot dog model so first you have your little baby model that has not seen the world yet and you got to start feeding it images about hot dogs but you also have to show it pictures of not hot dogs you also want to show it some tricky cases like this dog that looks like a hot dog and this hot dog sausage doesn't have a bun I don't know if that's still considered a hot dog is that actually a hot dog though anyways you do this many many times and it starts to learn what is considered a hot dog and what is not considered a hot dog or more specifically what are the features that make it more hot dog like and what are the features that make it less likely to be a hot dog for example if it sees this cylindrical reddish thing it makes a note that this is an increased likelihood of that being a hot dog and it sees this white stuff around this red thing and again it will make a note that there's an increase in a likelihood of being this hot dog it will then come up a score with its prediction of How likely it is a hot dog but for example if it sees this triangular looking thing it goes like huh triangles are not hot dog like so it decreases the likelihood of that being a hot dog and so on and so forth until it gets better and better at predicting whether it's a hot dog or not a hot dog now let's take a look at Chachi BT over here which is also a machine learning model except in this case the data we're feeding it is a bunch of text Data like the entire internet's Text data and it uses his data to predict the next words in a sentence it's based upon its previous words for example if you have the words I am and the word sleeping it'll give a likelihood of that being the next word which is probably relatively high but there can also be a word like potato which probably has a pretty low likelihood of being an next word so the algorithm picks the word with the highest probability and it somehow magically is able to chain these together to form coherent sentences isn't that crazy like thinking about how it actually works of course I'm simplifying things a little bit here for now though what's very exciting is that you can actually use these AI models pretty easy easily to start building your own AI products say like this AI personal assistant that's able to schedule your life and stuff and by easily I mean if you have zero knowledge about coding it'll probably take you about a month or if you have some intermediate level of coding it'll take you like less than a week or two what you need to learn first is the basics of python variables data types if statements Loops objectoriented programming and apis which stands for application programming interfaces and it's for interacting with other people's software I'm also going to give you some suggestions for resources brilliant has a super beginner friendly course which is super interactive which is great for people with very short attention spans cuz you can like you know do the little dios and click things and things pop up you can get started with brilliant for free they also are the sponsor of today's video If you prefer video learning there is this really good introduction to python from free code camp and if you're into text or reading textbooks so me personally I'm not that into textbooks because it makes me really bored easily but I have heard that this book automate the boring stuff is a really good introduction I want you to especially focus on understanding apis and how to use them because that's how we're going to be able to use these AI models that other people made next we're going to learn the very Basics about large language models which are the AI models that power chat Bots like chat gbt brilliant also has a crash

how to use AI models through apis but you still don't really know how they work or how to make your own to be able to do that it's kind of like building the foundations of the building you need to lay a very solid foundation first by getting a better understanding of machine learning but before we can dive into the machine learning algorithms themselves we still need to take a step back and break it down into its sub fields of fundamental mathematics statistics and programming specifically in Python what you need to learn one at this intermediate level of python you need to start learning more modules that are related to data manipulation because you need to use data in order to teach your machine learning model stuff so we need to learn the modules of numpy pandas matpa live for data visualization and pyit learn for building machine learning models there are so many great tutorials and courses out there and I'll link them below free code Camp is probably my favorite resource and if you're into books python for data analysis I've heard is very good now math these scary stuff A lot of people are intimidated by math I am also intimidated by math math so the good news is that you don't need to learn that much of math you don't need to sit there and learn how to do like derivatives by hand you just need to understand like the concept of calculus the contract of what a matrix is for linear algebra how to use probability to determine the likelihood of something that's about to happen these are the foundations of machine learning models for my short attention span friends especially I feel like for math math is like especially challenging because it's it can be so boring brilliant is nice and interactive and it gives examples of things so I recommend the coures calculus fundamentals introduction to linear algebra and introduction to probability you can also take this math for ML specialization free on corsera if you want to dive a little bit deeper next up statistics you got to know things like descriptive statistics inferential statistics hypothesis testing Central limit theorem distributions confidence intervals it sounds like a lot but it's pretty much just first year statistics in college again brilliant is how I personally brushed up and learned more about statistics but I also love supplementing with my all-time favorite techdata YouTuber Josh starmer He is very short attention span friendly because how can you possibly get bored of someone singing about math don't be afraid of neur networks they're not scary if you want something more thorough there's a Standford course on corsera called introduction to statistics by the way a pro tip especially for subjects like math that are kind of like conceptual and hard to understand using chat PT as a personal tutor is literally a game changer it can help explain difficult Concepts and give analogies for things uh where you can like use it to dive deeper into stuff so I'm not going to go into too much detail about how to do that because I already made a video which I'll link over here talking about how to use CH PT as a learning tool highly recommend all right all right now we have truly laid a very solid foundation and we can now dive into machine learning yay machine learning as a field is very very large and there's a lot of different aspects of it so I only want you to focus on understanding the categories of different algorithms and some of the example algorithms out there stuff like regressions K means clustering decision trees Etc and understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning Josh starmer is absolutely my go-to for machine learning content I give Josh full credit for me actually graduating my Master's Degree because I took with this really hard machine learning course and yeah like I would not have graduated without him if you wanted something a little bit more thorough there's also the Stanford and deeplearning.ai course called machine learning specialization all right we' have expanded into the next [Music] Circle neurons are cells in your brain that form a network so that you're able to think and do stuff now ai is modeled after our brains we have these nodes that represent neurons which create what we call artificial neuron networks if you feed these neuron networks data it's able to start learning by itself kind of like when a baby is first born it doesn't really like have anything in its brain but as it starts having more experiences collecting more data it's able to start learning by itself now if you start stacking layers and layers of these neurons together things start getting really interesting and you can create models that are capable of doing incredible tasks this is called Deep learning cuz you got a lot of layers stack together and it's like very deep it's an advanced subfield of machine learning the hot dog no hot dog am model is a model that uses deep learning specifically in the field of computer vision and the AI models that powers chat Bots like chat gbt are called large language models they also use deep learning in the field of natural language processing okay so at this point we're another layer deep and learning about deep learning deep learning layer deep and learning about specializations like computer vision and large language models some recommended resources Brilliance introduction in neuron Network covers the basics and the artificial neuron Network course goes into deep learning again Josh sarmer is just is the best and if you want to go a little bit deeper there's a corsera specialization in deep learning now at this point you can also start branching out into different sub Fields like for example you're interested in hot dogs and not hot dogs you can dive deeper into computer vision and here's also a free corsera specialization on it or if you're interested in large language models and things like that you can dive deeper into natural language processing here's another specialization of corsera a final quick tip okay I do know I give a lot of different resources here but that's mostly just to give you guys a variety based upon what kind of learning style you have do not I repeat do not try to go through all the different resources and try to like learn every single little thing and get like really obsessed with everything just choose one of these resources they're all amazing go through it and then start building your own projects you can build your own neuro networks contribute towards open source AI models and fine-tune other people's models now I want to talk a little bit more about the sponsor of today's video brilliant thank you brilliant I've already mentioned them a few times especially for short attention span friends because they're so interactive brilliant actually only specializ izes and stem subjects so that they're able to make the best courses to teach these subjects I personally love using brilliant whenever I want to learn new things and brush up on different skills especially the math and stats part I get so bored when I try to just like watch a video or do some courses um so just you know having those like little interactive things helps a lot in my understanding they have Timeless course offerings like math and stats programming and python as well as new course offerings like the neuron networks courses for the Deep learning and introduction to large language models you can join a millions of people already learning on brilliant I head on over to this link to get started for free also linked in description if you go through my link the first 200 people will get 20% off in annual membership all right that is the end of today's video thank you guys all so much for watching let me know in the comments if you're now interested in learning Ai and if you want me to make more videos related to learning AI things I don't know if you guys are into that okay anyways have a

want to learn AI so usually when you're trying to learn something new it look something like a straight line first you learn calculus linear algebra probability statistics programming machine learning deep learning Etc so kind of like that progression don't get me wrong you do need to learn these things eventually but my problem is that I can't even get past one of these subjects without getting really bored getting stuck and giving up hey no hate these are amazing resources so what if it's not the resources themselves that's the problem but the way that we use them is there a way that we can learn Ai and not give up introducing the renon method or if for some strange reason you don't like Naruto the concentric Circle method how does it work so in the middle of the renegon you have the thing that you want to learn which is AI we go from the middle and we go outwards so for the small circle we just need to learn the basics of AI such as a high level of how machine Learning Works how large language models work but most importantly how do you use these models with python don't worry I'll go into a lot more detail about exactly what you need to learn and recommend some resources later but the point is that you learn just enough so that you're able to build a really cool AI thing like this study tool or personal AI assistant as soon as possible like I'm saying realistically 1 month if you have zero coding experience and a week or two if you have some intermediate experience in Python and then after you do this we take this excitement and satisfaction of building this really cool thing and we use that as motivation to go into the next layer of the circle we dive a little bit deeper into what exactly is machine learning how does it work as some of the math surrounding it which would allow us to then build something else that is really cool and then use that as motivation to expand again into the next level of the circle so you kind of just repeat this cycle so that you're learning more and more advanced things and also getting to apply them until you become quite Advent and be able to tr truly understand AI models like how chat GPT works and even build your own so what is machine learning let's start with a hot dog do pizza yes do pizza that's that's it it only does hot dogs no and a naha dog so that was an example of machine learning machine learning is a way for computers to learn and make decisions by themselves by studying a recognizing patterns in data there are many different types of machine learning models and this one specifically is called a CNS a convolutional neuron Network by the way I might be throwing some terminology here and there but don't worry about remembering things and understanding I'm just putting these here so as you're learning you kind of go like oh like she talked about this like I'm learning this right now I'll be explaining more about how these work later in the video as well but first let's talk about how Jimmy was able to build this hot dog not hot dog model so first you have your little baby model that has not seen the world yet and you got to start feeding it images about hot dogs but you also have to show it pictures of not hot dogs you also want to show it some tricky cases like this dog that looks like a hot dog and this hot dog sausage doesn't have a bun I don't know if that's still considered a hot dog is that actually a hot dog though anyways you do this many many times and it starts to learn what is considered a hot dog and what is not considered a hot dog or more specifically what are the features that make it more hot dog like and what are the features that make it less likely to be a hot dog for example if it sees this cylindrical reddish thing it makes a note that this is an increased likelihood of that being a hot dog and it sees this white stuff around this red thing and again it will make a note that there's an increase in a likelihood of being this hot dog it will then come up a score with its prediction of How likely it is a hot dog but for example if it sees this triangular looking thing it goes like huh triangles are not hot dog like so it decreases the likelihood of that being a hot dog and so on and so forth until it gets better and better at predicting whether it's a hot dog or not a hot dog now let's take a look at Chachi BT over here which is also a machine learning model except in this case the data we're feeding it is a bunch of text Data like the entire internet's Text data and it uses his data to predict the next words in a sentence it's based upon its previous words for example if you have the words I am and the word sleeping it'll give a likelihood of that being the next word which is probably relatively high but there can also be a word like potato which probably has a pretty low likelihood of being an next word so the algorithm picks the word with the highest probability and it somehow magically is able to chain these together to form coherent sentences isn't that crazy like thinking about how it actually works of course I'm simplifying things a little bit here for now though what's very exciting is that you can actually use these AI models pretty easy easily to start building your own AI products say like this AI personal assistant that's able to schedule your life and stuff and by easily I mean if you have zero knowledge about coding it'll probably take you about a month or if you have some intermediate level of coding it'll take you like less than a week or two what you need to learn first is the basics of python variables data types if statements Loops objectoriented programming and apis which stands for application programming interfaces and it's for interacting with other people's software I'm also going to give you some suggestions for resources brilliant has a super beginner friendly course which is super interactive which is great for people with very short attention spans cuz you can like you know do the little dios and click things and things pop up you can get started with brilliant for free they also are the sponsor of today's video If you prefer video learning there is this really good introduction to python from free code camp and if you're into text or reading textbooks so me personally I'm not that into textbooks because it makes me really bored easily but I have heard that this book automate the boring stuff is a really good introduction I want you to especially focus on understanding apis and how to use them because that's how we're going to be able to use these AI models that other people made next we're going to learn the very Basics about large language models which are the AI models that power chat Bots like chat gbt brilliant also has a crash course on large language models which is super beginner friendly like you don't even need to know how to code but if you're into videos this is a 1-hour introduction to large language models by Andre karthy who is an expert in this field next up we're going to do this course on prompt engineering for developers this course is only an hour long and is completely free from deeplearning.ai but seriously this is such a good course in starting to build AI products using open AI apis it teaches you prompt engineering en able to interact with AI models and how to connect and use the API to access the models all right at this point you have the basics of building AI products you can use open AI apis in order to build chat Bots and personal assistance you can also generate images from Models like do also link some more apis that you can use to generate text to video and other cool things you can do also link some examples of projects that you can build Link description you now know

that's how we're going to be able to use these AI models that other people made next we're going to learn the very Basics about large language models which are the AI models that power chat Bots like chat gbt brilliant also has a crash course on large language models which is super beginner friendly like you don't even need to know how to code but if you're into videos this is a 1-hour introduction to large language models by Andre karthy who is an expert in this field next up we're going to do this course on prompt engineering for developers this course is only an hour long and is completely free from deeplearning.ai but seriously this is such a good course in starting to build AI products using open AI apis it teaches you prompt engineering en able to interact with AI models and how to connect and use the API to access the models all right at this point you have the basics of building AI products you can use open AI apis in order to build chat Bots and personal assistance you can also generate images from Models like do also link some more apis that you can use to generate text to video and other cool things you can do also link some examples of projects that you can build Link description you now know how to use AI models through apis but you still don't really know how they work or how to make your own to be able to do that it's kind of like building the foundations of the building you need to lay a very solid foundation first by getting a better understanding of machine learning but before we can dive into the machine learning algorithms themselves we still need to take a step back and break it down into its sub fields of fundamental mathematics statistics and programming specifically in Python what you need to learn one at this intermediate level of python you need to start learning more modules that are related to data manipulation because you need to use data in order to teach your machine learning model stuff so we need to learn the modules of numpy pandas matpa live for data visualization and pyit learn for building machine learning models there are so many great tutorials and courses out there and I'll link them below free code Camp is probably my favorite resource and if you're into books python for data analysis I've heard is very good now math these scary stuff A lot of people are intimidated by math I am also intimidated by math math so the good news is that you don't need to learn that much of math you don't need to sit there and learn how to do like derivatives by hand you just need to understand like the concept of calculus the contract of what a matrix is for linear algebra how to use probability to determine the likelihood of something that's about to happen these are the foundations of machine learning models for my short attention span friends especially I feel like for math math is like especially challenging because it's it can be so boring brilliant is nice and interactive and it gives examples of things so I recommend the coures calculus fundamentals introduction to linear algebra and introduction to probability you can also take this math for ML specialization free on corsera if you want to dive a little bit deeper next up statistics you got to know things like descriptive statistics inferential statistics hypothesis testing Central limit theorem distributions confidence intervals it sounds like a lot but it's pretty much just first year statistics in college again brilliant is how I personally brushed up and learned more about statistics but I also love supplementing with my",

math don't be afraid of neur networks they're not scary if you want something more thorough there's a Standford course on corsera called introduction to statistics by the way a pro tip especially for subjects like math that are kind of like conceptual and hard to understand using chat PT as a personal tutor is literally a game changer it can help explain difficult Concepts and give analogies for things uh where you can like use it to dive deeper into stuff so I'm not going to go into too much detail about how to do that because I already made a video which I'll link over here talking about how to use CH PT as a learning tool highly recommend all right all right now we have truly laid a very solid foundation and we can now dive into machine learning yay machine learning as a field is very very large and there's a lot of different aspects of it so I only want you to focus on understanding the categories of different algorithms and some of the example algorithms out there stuff like regressions K means clustering decision trees Etc and understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning Josh starmer is absolutely my go-to for machine learning content I give Josh full credit for me actually graduating my Master's Degree because I took with this really hard machine learning course and yeah like I would not have graduated without him if you wanted something a little bit more thorough there's also the Stanford and deeplearning.ai course called machine learning specialization all right we' have expanded into the next [Music] Circle neurons are cells in your brain that form a network so that you're able to think and do stuff now ai is modeled after our brains we have these nodes that represent neurons which create what we call artificial neuron networks if you feed these neuron networks data it's able to start learning by itself kind of like when a baby is first born it doesn't really like have anything in its brain but as it starts having more experiences collecting more data it's able to start learning by itself now if you start stacking layers and layers of these neurons together things start getting really interesting and you can create models that are capable of doing incredible tasks this is called Deep learning cuz you got a lot of layers stack together and it's like very deep it's an advanced subfield of machine learning the hot dog no hot dog am model is a model that uses deep learning specifically in the field of computer vision and the AI models that powers chat Bots like chat gbt are called large language models they also use deep learning in the field of natural language processing okay so at this point we're another layer deep and learning about deep learning deep learning layer deep and learning about specializations like computer vision and large language models some recommended resources Brilliance introduction in neuron Network covers the basics and the artificial neuron Network course goes into deep learning again Josh sarmer is just is the best and if you want to go a little bit deeper there's a corsera specialization in deep learning now at this point you can also start branching out into different sub Fields like for example you're interested in hot dogs and not hot dogs you can dive deeper into computer vision and here's also a free corsera specialization on it or if you're interested in large language models and things like that you can dive deeper into natural language processing here's another specialization of corsera a final quick tip okay I do know I give a lot of different resources here but that's mostly just to give you guys a variety based upon what kind of learning style you have do not I repeat do not try to go through all the different resources and try to like learn every single little thing and get like really obsessed with everything just choose one of these resources they're all amazing go through it and then start building your own projects you can build your own neuro networks contribute towards open source AI models and fine-tune other people's models now I want to talk a little bit more about the sponsor of today's video brilliant thank

is wet but I got to go somewhere after this video is for my short attention span friends who still want to learn AI so usually when you're trying to learn something new it look something like a straight line first you learn calculus linear algebra probability statistics programming machine learning deep learning Etc so kind of like that progression don't get me wrong you do need to learn these things eventually but my problem is that I can't even get past one of these subjects without getting really bored getting stuck and giving up hey no hate these are amazing resources so what if it's not the resources themselves that's the problem but the way that we use them is there a way that we can learn Ai and not give up introducing the renon method or if for some strange reason you don't like Naruto the concentric Circle method how does it work so in the middle of the renegon you have the thing that you want to learn which is AI we go from the middle and we go outwards so for the small circle we just need to learn the basics of AI such as a high level of how machine Learning Works how large language models work but most importantly how do you use these models with python don't worry I'll go into a lot more detail about exactly what you need to learn and recommend some resources later but the point is that you learn just enough so that you're able to build a really cool AI thing like this study tool or personal AI assistant as soon as possible like I'm saying realistically 1 month if you have zero coding experience and a week or two if you have some intermediate experience in Python and then after you do this we take this excitement and satisfaction of building this really cool thing and we use that as motivation to go into the next layer of the circle we dive a little bit deeper into what exactly is machine learning how does it work as some of the math surrounding it which would allow us to then build something else that is really cool and then use that as motivation to expand again into the next level of the circle so you kind of just repeat this cycle so that you're learning more and more advanced things and also getting to apply them until you become quite Advent and be able to tr truly understand AI models like how chat GPT works and even build your own so what is machine learning let's start with a hot dog do pizza yes do pizza that's that's it it only does hot dogs no and a naha dog so that was an example of machine learning machine learning is a way for computers to learn and make decisions by themselves by studying a recognizing patterns in data there are many different types of machine learning models and this one specifically is called a CNS a convolutional neuron Network by the way I might be throwing some terminology here and there but don't worry about remembering things and understanding I'm just putting these here so as you're learning you kind of go like oh like she talked about this like I'm learning this right now I'll be explaining more about how these work later in the video as well but first let's talk about how Jimmy was able to build this hot dog not hot dog model so first you have your little baby model that has not seen the world yet and you got to start feeding it images about hot dogs but you also have to show it pictures of not hot dogs you also want to show it some tricky cases like this dog that looks like a hot dog and this hot dog sausage doesn't have a bun I don't know if that's still considered a hot dog is that actually a hot dog though anyways you do this many many times and it starts to learn what is considered a hot dog and what is not considered a hot dog or more specifically what are the features that make it more hot dog like and what are the features that make it less likely to be a hot dog for example if it sees this cylindrical reddish thing it makes a note that this is an increased likelihood of that being a hot dog and it sees this white stuff around this red thing and again it will make a note that there's an increase in a likelihood of being this hot dog it will then come up a score with its prediction of How likely it is a hot dog but for example if it sees this triangular looking thing it goes like huh triangles are not hot dog like so it decreases the likelihood of that being a hot dog and so on and so forth until it gets better and better at predicting whether it's a hot dog or not a hot dog now let's take a look at Chachi BT over here which is also a machine learning model except in this case the data we're feeding it is a bunch of text Data like the entire internet's Text data and it uses his data to predict the next words in a sentence it's based upon its previous words for example if you have the words I am and the word sleeping it'll give a likelihood of that being the next word which is probably relatively high but there can also be a\n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nThe Renon Method suggests learning AI in a circular progression, starting with the basics and gradually expanding knowledge to build advanced AI models.\n\n# MAIN POINTS:\n1. Learning AI usually involves a linear progression of subjects such as calculus, linear algebra, programming, and machine learning.\n2. The Renon Method proposes a circular approach, starting with the basics of AI and gradually expanding knowledge and skills.\n3. The first level of the circle focuses on learning the basics of AI and using Python to build simple AI projects.\n4. After completing the first level, the excitement and satisfaction of building a cool AI project serve as motivation to dive deeper into machine learning.\n5. The second level involves learning more about machine learning and the math behind it to build more advanced AI models.\n6. The cycle continues, with each level of the circle expanding knowledge and pushing towards a deeper understanding of AI models.\n7. Machine learning is a way for computers to learn and make decisions by studying and recognizing patterns in data.\n8. One example of a machine learning model is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which learns to recognize features in images.\n9. Building a machine learning model involves training it with data, such as feeding images of hot dogs and not hot dogs to teach it to differentiate.\n10. ChatGPT, another machine learning model, uses text data to predict the next words in a sentence based on previous words.\n\n# TAKEAWAYS:\n1. The Renon Method offers a structured approach to learning AI, starting with basic concepts and gradually building knowledge and skills.\n2. Learning AI doesn't have to follow a linear progression and can be tackled in a circular manner.\n3.

trending really really fast for the past few weeks and we see multiple teams made huge progress towards this direction from hyper R teams publish a self operating computer framework where they let GPD 4V to have direct access and control of your whole computer so you can open spotlight to search for any apps like Google Chrome conduct actions like search for a specific URL go to Google doc write a h block with your Google account as well as more advanced actions like Bro internet or the pizza book fly tickets on the other hand we also see Team from multi where they showcase a web AI agent that has direct access to the web browser and it completes California online driving test successfully by itself this is the first fully autonomous completion of real world human knowledge task by AI so this type of agent system where it give super powerful multimodal model like GPT 4V direct computer access to let it become a self-operating computer is such a fascinating idea as it seems like unlocks so much potentials so I did a bit research and experimentation and today I want to talk about what are the use case and opportunities I see that the self-operating computer can enable and in the end I'm going to take you through a example work through of how to build an AI that have direct control of your web browser and do sophisticated web research and tasks so let's get it firstly let's talk about what are the use case and Market opportunities this can potentially unlock one way for me to look at this is what were the previous attempts when people Tred to build such a similar system what were the use case and limitations and what are new technology or changes now that can potentially change the dynamic one very direct Market category in my opinion is RPA which represent for robotic process automation it is basically category of software that help Enterprise to build automated robot that can handle repetitive and standardized task like handle invoice or data entry jobs one of the most representative platform in this category is is UI pass where they build a platform that allow you to build that here type of automation to access and interact directly with your desktop apps from calculators browser interactions as well as Excel or laxi system that has no API endpoint that can be used and this provide huge amount of value to Enterprise where they have a lot of admin tasks that simply move data from one system to another it is fast growing signment where at 2022 Enterprise already spend more than $3 billion every year on those process automation but the limitation of those RPA solution are also quite clear most of those system can't really handle non-standardized or everchanging process not to mention process that involve more complex decision making for example let's say I am shoe brand and I want the robot to do the data scripting of the pricing and product from Nike idas and Puma I actually need to build very specific process for every single website because each website structure is different and if one of them update the website structure the previous automation is going to break it as well so every single RPA process you build is very specific and can be fragile to any environment change thus the setup cost is very high that's why currently all those RPA are mainly used for Enterprise where they have standardized and repetitive task that has huge volume to justify the cost but that's also why those multimodal AI agent that can directly control the computer and browser is so exciting because theoretically they can handle much more complex situation with much less setup cost in the data scpt quipping example instead of me setting a very specific automation to tell robot that you need to look at this HTML tag to get this I can simply give agent URL of different competitors and let it automatically navigates the website take a screenshot and extract data regardless of format change because agent will do the decision making itself and on the other hand those AI agent can go Way Beyond just automation it can complete intelligent task like for a customer support agent you can look through the conversation history with the customer summarize it in auto automatically feeling the better data and escalate to the writing so if done well I believe this web AI agent can potentially open up the market for Consumer use case that has much less volume and also go beyond just normal automation but complete actual digital worker job like customer support sales and marketing as agent has ability to access more and more different systems I feel we're definitely getting closer and closer to have those real AI workers to be deployed in the companies however I often found the big gap to deliver useful AI worker solution it's not necessarily just the understanding of Technology also the understanding of the endtoend workflow for specific job functions that's why I want to introduce you to a research report that hopspot just did where they survey and interviewed more than 1,400 Global sales leaders to really understand how does the modern sales repap team Works what does their whole end to end workflow look like they cover a lot of insights from the key challenges and opportunities the sales team are facing in 2024 as as well as how big amount of sales reps shift into\n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE

tasks they also dive into the best practice as well as a top AI use case those sales leaders are adopting at the moment so this game a super useful Deep dive of how sales function works and what other the key opportunities there I found it super useful so if you're trying to build an AI agent for sales function I definitely recommend you go have look you can click on the link in the description below to download this report for free now let's back to building a AI web agent but how can we get the AI agent to actually control the browser or even the whole computer there are two common implementation so far one method is designed before multimodal model like GPD 4V is available where they basically get a whole HTML Dom which represent the web page simplify a little bit and send as part of prompt to GPT 3.5 or GPD 4 to let it decide what's the next step should agent interact with this specific Dom element which could be button or input box or link to navigator and BAS based on output of gbt it red do actual interaction with the web browser through common Library like pop tier selenium or playwright those are all Frameworks that has been designed before for endtoend testing for web applications which means they have ability to interact with web apps and one project that is quite representative is called taxi AI where they develop an open source chome plugin that people can give a specific task like create a calendar event where it will pass the whole Dom to gbd4 and it decide what should be done next it is already able to interact with a few popular website like searching and play specific movie on Netflix create calendar event on Google Calendar the downside of this method is very clear because it is sending the Dom to large language model so there huge amount of noise that has been censored so it is very slow cost a lot of money because we are sending a lot of information and often large model is not able to do accurate interaction as the information is not clean but with multimodel like GPT 4V the solution seems a lot more viable solution is often take screenshot of the web page of desktop computer draw different bonding box on the web page to annotate parts that can be interactive so gbd 4B can give better instruction about which element to interact with and form research by giving proper annotation GPD 4B can complete task much much better so you basically take screenshot generate annotation send the screenshot with annotation to multi mod model like GPD 4V so that it can give instruction about what's the next step then again use those common libraries to control the computer or browser and this is exactly how the self-operating computer framework works if you try out the self operating computer GitHub link you will see the way it works it will take a screenshot of your current desktop computer at a simple annotation by dividing the screen into different grade so GPD 4B can use this to communicate where to click and they give a prompt to GPD 4B that giving the screenshot and go is should output four different outcome it can be either simulate a mouse click interaction type on a keyboard or search which is a spoly search function on MacBook that can be used for quickly access application and depends on the types of output gbd4 can call different functions if it is mouse click it will output adjacent format about the position it should click including the X and Y Bas on the personage information sound great and then call different actions from Mouse click to keyboard type to search and the actual interaction is done by package called py Auto gii which is python package that can simulate Those computer interactions like can Mouse click and keyboard interaction for example I can try to run this self-operating computer by open Terminal and try operate it will open this and I can click okay to start and give instruction what is the latest weather in C Australia and click enter it refers to take a screenshot as you can see on the top to and then feed this screenshot to gbt 4V which open the Chrome and then it will focus on the URL input bar typing the information Sydney Australia weather and take a screenshot again to feed this information back to GPD 4V and once it's finished it will output information here the latest weather information Sy is this one however the main challenge at the moment is I don't think this personage grade annotation is working really well I can often see the mouse interaction stuck at some weird position that's probably because GPD 4V failed to give very accurate estimation about percentage but on the other hand I'm also not too sure what's better solution would be because it is desktop computer there's no easy way to manipulate and create bounding box however if we change the scope of AI agent to just web browser then accuracy should be much higher because we can easily use CSS to create those bounding box for web pages and give much more accurate annotation for GPD 4V and this is example I want to take you through today I'm going to show you a stepbystep\n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\n\nThis content discusses the

Json that will automatically log all the package that has been used for this project and on the other hand also need to do npm install poer extra and now we can try to run this by doing no screenshot.jpg if you open inside it a screenshot of this Wikipedia page so that means this screenshot is actually working the problem is with what we have here now it will not use my existing Chrome profile which means it won't be able to access website like LinkedIn Instagram or any other website that I have paid the subscription on so you will need to download a special Chrome version called Chrome Canary and then I will go to a special folder from users your username library application support Google and inside Chrome you will have default folder I'll copy this folder and go back to the Chrome and open Chrome can folder then paste in this default folder and replace existing one so this will copy all my old cookie and profile from the other account to this one and after I will open Google chrom canery and try to log in with all the accounts I need like LinkedIn Instagram and then I will come back to screenshot.jpg Pap tier should open and in my case it will be the Google Canary version and also the user data directory I will point to Google Chrome Canary SL default which is default profile but if you want to change this to be other's profile you can change it to like profile one or profile two and I will also add a weit for timeout function here as well because sometimes the web page can take a while to load so with this pop should be able to access any website possible with my own Chrome profile let's try this I can try again by doing no screenshot doj and once finished I should take screenshot of a LinkedIn web page with the full page lens you can play with timeout value a bit more depends on your internet speed so this JS file will be able to take screenshot of any website next step is we want to create a python file that can call this Javascript file to take a screenshot and then let GPT 4V to extract data from this screenshot so our create a vision scripper py file and also aemv file to store the open AI API key inside Vision scripper we will import\n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\n\nThis article explains how to build a web AI agent that can navigate websites, take screenshots, and perform web tasks using GPT-4V and a special Chrome version.\n\n# MAIN POINTS:\n\n1.

JS I can give it instruction what's the weather like inin so it will firstly try to script the website and then return answer that insan is around 20\u00b0 if you click on the screenshot jpack it actually go to Google highlight all the interactive links or input box which means it will be able to scrip further if it needs and also rate the information on the page and to test is ability to interact with website I can ask a photo op question it give me 10 days wether forecast for nor C and if the agent is smart it should be able to click on that specific link to get more information so I click enter in return message click on 10 days is weather nor C which is that specific link as you can see it successfully navigate to next page and which has 10 days forecast information and then GPD 4B read and return the list of answer to me on the other side I can also ask this AI agent to complete some sophisticated task for example I quite like the Instagram account epic travels and I want GB forv to figure out how can a company or business to be featured on Epic travels so our give askask figure out\n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nThis input provides a detailed explanation of how a web agent can navigate websites, interact with elements, and retrieve information required for various tasks.\n\n# MAIN POINTS:\n1. The web agent starts by calling GPT 4V and receiving a response message that includes the user's prompt and system messages.\n2. If the agent wants to click on a specific UI element, it retrieves the text of the links/buttons and interacts with the matching element.\n3. Clicking on an element may take the agent to a different page or open a menu, which prompts the agent to take a screenshot and set \"screenshot taken\" to true.\n4. If the agent message includes a URL, the agent navigates to that URL, takes a screenshot, and sets \"screenshot taken\" to true.\n5. When the screenshot is taken, the image is passed to GPT 4V, asking for instructions and providing the screenshot of the current website.\n6. The agent continues to navigate and interact with links until it completes the task or finds the answer to the user's question.\n7. Once finished, the agent displays the result to the user and waits for further instructions.\n8. The web agent can retrieve weather information, click on specific links, and perform sophisticated tasks like figuring out how a business can be featured on a certain platform.\n\n# TAKEAWAYS:\n1. A web agent can automate tasks by navigating websites, interacting with UI elements, and retrieving information.\n2. The agent can click on links and buttons using the text provided and interact with the corresponding web elements.\n3. Taking screenshots at specific points helps gather information and track progress.\n4. GPT 4V can provide instructions based on the screenshot of the current website, enhancing the agent's capabilities.\n5. The web agent can handle a variety of tasks, from retrieving weather information to completing complex tasks like business feature requests."}

[Music] welcome to this tutorial on creating a chat gbt chatbot with flask Ginger python [Music] open AI it's all the things we're gonna do it fully functional chatbot that can take user input and send it to open AI the openai gods and they do something with it and send it back and we get words you can ask it questions it will say words in response they might not make sense but they will be words an answer to a question or another question sometimes sometimes something totally random sometimes it'll just say like I have a dog and it's you just run with it sometimes it'll just say like the word yellow that's one of my favorites it's very helpful AI is changing the world so let's get started we're doing it I'm in pycharm in a new project with a virtual environment activated we need a few libraries and packages so let's open our terminal and do a few pip installs we need to pip install flask open AI and python dash dot ends now I'm just going to still in my terminal I'm going to check that I'm in my Project's root directory with PWD good looks like we're in the right place from here I'll create our main python file with touch app.pi then I will open app.pi and we'll do some imports right at the top first we'll take care of flask from flask import flask with a capital f render template and request this Line Imports the flask web framework then the render template module allows us to render HTML templates and the request module handles HTTP requests we'll do a few more Imports let's import open AI import OS and then from Dot N import load Dot N these lines import the openai client which gives us access to their API and the OS module and the load.n function from Dot N let us load environment variables from a DOT EnV file that we're going to create and we'll do that to store our openai API key outside of our script and then bring it into this script I have a video on using dot ENB files in Python if that's something you keep coming across and you just want to take care of understanding how it works you can watch that video if you don't already have an openai API key you just have to go to the site and if you don't have an account create an account and then once you create an account you can get an API key and I'll just quickly walk through how that's done you go to this website and you'll be prompted to uh to log in if you don't have an account create an account and then we get an API key copy that key and come back to pycharm and then we'll create that.emd file I was talking about earlier let's go back into the terminal and touch dot EnV and open.end at the top of this file paste in your API key and then assign it to a key like this open AI underscore API underscore key and now we can load this API key into our script without actually putting it in the script and that's like I said best practice when you're working with passwords API Keys database credentials whatever okay let's write our script we're back in app.pi now let's load underscore Dot N this line will load the environment variables from our DOT EnV file which is in our project directory and our environment variable in this case is the API key that we just stored so let's go ahead and bring that API key in we'll say openai dot API underscore key gets OS dot Environ and then your API key so the key it's a key value pair so the key is open AI underscore API underscore key which is what we called it here in our DOT EnV file let's print this so far so that we can make sure that our API key is coming into this file correctly so we should get our API key as output in our console print openai dot API key run the we see our API key in the console so that's working let's hash out that print statement and we'll keep moving now let's create a class Gap we will eventually need two API endpoints one to handle the initial landing page of the app and that's where the user will enter their first question to our chat bot the other endpoint will take the user's question and it'll run it through the openai API and get the response to the question and then it'll render that response out in HTML let's get the app created so we say app and that gets flask and then double underscore name and another double underscore this line creates a new flask app object and a name here refers to the name of the script which is at let's create our apps first root and that's the landing page of our app this only gets rendered once when our app is being used it's when the user first gets to the app and it's where the user will enter their first question to the chatbot let's code that decorators start with the add symbol and you can read more about decorators generally in the python Docs we'll say at app.root and then this is our home page route and in quotes just a forward slash and then our function is deaf home for a homepage function and we just want to return render template and the template we're going to render is index.html so this code defines a route for the home page of the web app and when a user navigates to the root URL which is just that forward slash the home function here is called and that will render index.html and we're about to create that template before we create index.html I want to set up the beginning of our next API route because as you'll see in index.html we will refer to this other route and it'll be a little less confusing when we work through index.html if we just get the foundation of this root setup so let's get it set up at app dot root and this time we will say forward slash chat bot and methods will be post and then our function is Def chat bot and we'll just say pass for now so that pycharm doesn't freak out when we leave the script and go work on index.html remember we set up our first route to render index.html here so let's create that file in a templates directory in your project root create a directory called templates I'll do this from the terminal with make dir templates and then I'll simultaneously CD into my new templates directory and CD templates so I'm now in the new templates directory I'll create a new file and I'll open it so we'll run touch index.html and open index.html then I'm going to drop some HTML in here and then I'll walk you through what this code is doing this is a really basic HTML file but it's doing something cool and that is rendering the chat bot root that we just created and we left with pass in it and it's rendering it using the Jinja double curly braces but let's start at the top here so we have the head section which just displays our site's title my chatbot and then we have the body section with a heading chat with me and that will be the title that shows up on our app web page then we have a form and this is where we first see Ginger being awesome the expression URL for chat bot in curly braces here that generates our API endpoint that will handle our chatbot functionality and that's the API route that we just set up with pass so that we'd be able to follow along here in index.html then we have a form with a submit button the user will enter their chatbot question in this form and then they'll click the submit button the question from the user will be sent to the chat bot route that we just set up and the chatbot route will make an API call to open Ai and then it'll return chat box reply and that reply will get rendered out in the next HTML template we'll create let's go finish coding that chatbot route so let's go back to app.pi and we'll hash out this pass I'm going to code this with you so I'll code it out slowly so you can follow along and then we'll walk through it foreign thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] all right so what's going on here this code defines a route for the chat bot page of the web app and when a user submits a message through the chatbot form which is the post request to the chatbot route the chat bot function here is called the function gets the user's message from the request object and then it uses the openai API to generate the response the response comes back with a few choices so we'll extract the choice at index 0 as text with DOT text and then we strip out white space with DOT strip the response is then added to a chat history list and the chatbot.html template that we're about to create is rendered with the user's input and the Bots response the HTML code in the chatbot.html file that we'll make in a second is another template that contains placeholders enclosed in double curly braces and those are replaced by actual values at runtime and again that's Jinja doing its magic so let's go create chatbot.html let's make sure we're in our templates directory so we're on PWD in your terminal and we'll see where we are okay good now we'll create a file chatbot.html we're gonna be lazy and copy index.html and simultaneously rename it as chatbot and then edit that copied file we can do this from the terminal so we'll just run CP index.html chatbot.html and this copies index.html and pastes it and simultaneously renames it and then we can open chatbot.html and we'll modify this file we'll leave everything through the H1 tag the same and then after that we'll render out the last question the user asked and the last bot response to that question and we'll leave\n", "response": "# OUTPUT\n\n- title of the youtube video:

API key in the console so that's working let's hash out that print statement and we'll keep moving now let's create a class Gap we will eventually need two API endpoints one to handle the initial landing page of the app and that's where the user will enter their first question to our chat bot the other endpoint will take the user's question and it'll run it through the openai API and get the response to the question and then it'll render that response out in HTML let's get the app created so we say app and that gets flask and then double underscore name and another double underscore this line creates a new flask app object and a name here refers to the name of the script which is at let's create our apps first root and that's the landing page of our app this only gets rendered once when our app is being used it's when the user first gets to the app and it's where the user will enter their first question to the chatbot let's code that decorators start with the add symbol and you can read more about decorators generally in the python Docs we'll say at app.root and then this is our home page route and in quotes just a forward slash and then our function is deaf home for a homepage function and we just want to return render template and the template we're going to render is index.html so this code defines a route for the home page of the web app and when a user navigates to the root URL which is just that forward slash the home function here is called and that will render index.html and we're about to create that template before we create index.html I want to set up the beginning of our next API route because as you'll see in index.html we will refer to this other route and it'll be a little less confusing when we work through index.html if we just get the foundation of this root setup so let's get it set up at app dot root and this time we will say forward slash chat bot and methods will be post and then our function is Def chat bot and we'll just say pass for now so that pycharm doesn't freak out when we leave the script and go work on index.html remember we set up our first route to render index.html here so let's create that file in a templates directory in your project root create a directory called templates I'll do this from the terminal with make dir templates and then I'll simultaneously CD into my new templates directory and CD templates so I'm now in the new templates directory I'll create a new file and I'll open it so we'll run touch index.html and open index.html then I'm going to drop some HTML in here and then I'll walk you through what this code is doing this is a really basic HTML file but it's doing something cool and that is rendering the chat bot root that we just created and we left with pass in it and it's rendering it using the Jinja double curly braces but let's start at the top here so we have the head section which just displays our site's title my chatbot and then we have the body section with a heading chat with me and that will be the title that shows up on our app web page then we have a form and this is where we first see Ginger being awesome the expression URL for chat bot in curly braces here that generates our API endpoint that will handle our chatbot functionality and that's the API route that we just set up with pass so that we'd be able to follow along here in index.html then we have a form with a submit button the user will enter their chatbot question in this form and then they'll click the submit button the question from the user will be sent to the chat bot route that we just set up and the chatbot route will make an API call to open Ai and then it'll return chat box reply and that reply will get rendered out in the next HTML template we'll create let's go finish coding that chatbot route so let's go back to app.pi and we'll hash out this pass I'm going to code this with you so I'll code it out slowly so you can follow along and then we'll walk through it foreign thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] all right so what's going on here this code defines a route for the chat bot page of the web app and when a user submits a message through the chatbot form which is the post request to the chatbot route the chat bot function here is called the function gets the user's message from the request object and then it uses the openai API to generate the response the response comes back with a few choices so we'll extract the choice at index 0 as text with DOT text and then we strip out white space with DOT strip the response is then added to a chat history list and the chatbot.html template that we're about to create is rendered with the user's input and the Bots response the HTML code in the chatbot.html file that we'll make in a second is another template that contains placeholders enclosed in double curly braces and those are replaced by actual values at runtime and again that's Jinja doing its magic so let's go create chatbot.html let's make sure we're in our templates directory so we're on PWD in your terminal and we'll see where we are okay good now we'll create a file chatbot.html we're gonna be lazy and copy index.html and simultaneously rename it as chatbot and then edit that copied file we can do this from the terminal so we'll just run CP index.html chatbot.html and this copies index.html and pastes it and simultaneously renames it and then we can open chatbot.html and we'll modify this file we'll leave everything through the H1 tag the same and then after that we'll render out the last question the user asked and the last bot response to that question and we'll leave\n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nThis tutorial walks through the process of creating a functional chatbot

caught my attention and a lot of people's attention and that paper is self rewarding self rewarding language models it is a paper from New York University and also meta AI why is this paper interesting is what I was trying to Del dive deeper into the main thing here is uh as the title suggests you might have already guessed it that this is a paper that talks about models rewarding itself so the concept reward comes from reinforcement learning but why is it interesting why is everybody talking about it the first reason is if you think about large language models people are building a lot of large language models and one problem is still there and that problem is alignment so how do you make these models as good as human beings or how do you make these models value human values this is the question that everybody has been trying to solve that is one of the biggest bottleneck in fact a lot of times open AA has been been blamed for lobotomizing the model by doing rlf reinforcement learning from Human feedback and in the last few weeks or I should say few months there is another very popular technique that has risen up to the level where rlf may not be very important it so that new technique is called DPW direct preference optimization so it has got a preference pair or a preference data set and based on which the model has been trained or aligned or fine tune so whatever that is the final stage is DPO now what this paper is trying to do is this paper is saying that you do not need humans at all even to generate the preference data set you can skip humans I mean a little bit of human is required for the SE data set but you can skip humans a rest of the process you can have model zero build model one based on it build model two based on it build model three based on it and this model three like let's say llama 2 70 billion parameter model would be as good as mral medium so this is a very huge claim and I want to dive deeper into how they go went about it and what this paper is suggesting first of all this is still experimental I don't see like a data or model for us to play with it so take it with a pinch of Sal so the first thing is what is this paper this is self-rewarding language models in this study or in this work they're talking about a self- rewarding language model where the language model itself is used as an llm as a judge and this is not the first time we are seeing llm as a judge llm as a judge is a very popular Concept in fact a lot of popular benchmarks use gp4 as a judge for example I think mty bench maybe if I'm right empty bench uses gp4 to ultimately score the llm responses so there are a lot of benchmarks and a lot of existing techniques that use one of the best models like gp4 to score the response so llm as judge is a very popular concept so they're using llm as as a judge prompting to provide its own rewards during the training so we show that iterative DPO direct preference optimization training not only does instruction following ability improve but also the ability to provide high quality rewards to itself this is the main impact the most important thing of this paper is that they figured out that the it's not only the instruction following ability improves but also to provide high quality rewards to it like to the model in itself so fine tuning Lama 2 70 billion on three iterations like I said m0 is the base model M1 M2 M3 of our approach yields a model that outperforms many existing systems on alpaka evil 2.0 leaderboard including claw 2 Gemini Pro and GPD 40613 the latest version I guess while only a preliminary study this work opens the door to the possibility of models that can continually improve in both axes now one thing to note is uh very later somewhere in this they also acknowledge that this system may not hold entirely true or may not scale up in the real world scenario because sometimes it might saturate see at the end of the day you are using a base model to reward or create instruction data set and then reward the model so how much it would scale in the real environment I think that is something that we need to see whether it is going to saturate whether you know after a point it just goes garbage in garbage out that is not something that we know yet but yeah we have a model that can do certain things how does it work there are two main steps one is the self instruction creation the second one is the instruction following training so you have got Model T and you have got model t+1 so always remember the model t+1 uses the data and the rewards generated by Model T So Model T is like model zero and model one is M1 is Created from the data that is let's say created from model zero and what kind of data that it creates is the main thing so it tries to create a couple of things or at least the steps the first one is an instruction following step the second one is a self instruction creation step and uh and that is where the concept of AI feedback comes into picture and AI feedback data set AI F also will come into picture and if you are familiar with this channel uh you might have already seen that we have covered a different technique called RL a so rlf reinforcement learning from Human feedback is a technique where human beings sit read the question OT the response or score the response and then give it back and that goes back to the reward training for the model and using reinforcement learning the model is improved RL aif is taking the human out of the loop and then putting an AI there and to reward so this the paper also acknowledges like later in this paper you would also see that they would have acknowledge that there are techniques like RL a if that is already available where the model has been used as a as a reward uh you know the scoring mechanism but if you see here what is the model is creating so the model is first trying to create a couple of things one they're creating uh they're starting so the first thing is you have a base model you have a base base model and as you can see in the setup you have a base model and uh the model then what it tries to do is it tries to use a seed data for instruction fine tuning and this is the only place where human beings data is used like uh or I mean technically the base model also has got human data but this is this is where the human author examples are used and from that that is what they're calling as sft Baseline and from that is now you have a new set of data called EFT C data now what is EFT this is evaluation data so anytime uh if is create if is there uh the model m0 is used uh to create something new and that is how the EFT comes into picture that is the evaluation so I think it comes from if in itself so you can see here that this results in 1775 train and 531 evaluation and uh they're also looking at the distributions to make sure that these do not overlap so if you see here at the end you can see here so they have created a TSN it's a very popular technique to Cluster things so you have got the if data you have got the a data and then you have got the EFT data so the distribution the it shows that when the distribution of if and EFT are separate that means the the overlap is less so the concept of overfitting or leakage uh Benchmark breaking on all these things reduce so so this dist distribution good on them that they have managed to do it now how is it working so like we discussed like there is a seed model there is a set of new prompts that generates the responses and from that there is a new set of rewards that are created and then from that the preference pays are created and then there is an iterative DPO that creates the new model in itself and then it continues so m0 M1 then M2 and M3 and you can see how the responses are created so this is a sample prompt and it basically says okay review the user question add the response the main thing is okay conclude the score in this particular format and you can also give the score and what is like how do you score it so this is basically given to the model for it to give you the response and this is the llm as a judge prompt so this is how the llm as a judg is and if you see the model sequence the iterative training you have got the m0 the base model the llm base model the Lama 2 L 70 billion parameter model without any fine tuning at all initialized with llama sorry initialized with m0 or in this case Lama 2 70 billion then fine tuned on if and EFT C data during sft during the supervis fine tuning process they used the if instruction fine tuning data set and the evaluation fine tuning data set to make sure that the model is instruction fine tune and that is your M1 now that M1 initialized and then trained with AI F M1 data using DPO how is this AI F created and that is what is is this is the AI F comes from there and that is what is used to train the model and then you have got one more step of you creating an M3 so what they have figured out is that when you have this kind of models like from the base model the EFT plus if supervis fine tuning then the iteration 2 and the iteration 3 you could see the models win rate increases so you can see let's say this is the with the when you compare it with the sft Baseline this is the M1 model this is the M2 model and this is the M3 I feel like almost I'm dealing with Apple MacBook so you have got M1 M2 M3 and you can see that in every iteration the self reward win rate actually increases and you can also see here that uh if you have got different models this\n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nThis paper explores the concept of self-rewarding language models, where models can generate their own rewards and improve without human intervention.\n\n# MAIN POINTS:\n1. Large language models face the challenge of alignment, or valuing human values.\n2. The paper proposes the use of direct preference optimization (DPO) to align models without human-generated preference data.\n3. The model zero is used to create instruction and evaluation data, which is then used to train subsequent models.\n4. Fine-tuning the models using DPO results in improved instruction following ability and the ability to provide high-quality rewards to itself.\n5. The resulting model outperforms existing systems on the Alpaca EVIL 2.0 leaderboard.\n6. The paper acknowledges potential limitations of the approach, such as scalability in real-world scenarios.\n7. The process involves two main steps: self-instruction creation and instruction following training.\n8. Model iterations (M1, M2, M3) show increased win rates in self-rewarding ability.\n9. The paper emphasizes that this is an experimental study and does not provide data or models for further exploration.\n10. The findings open possibilities for models that can continually improve in both instruction following and self-rewarding capabilities.\n\n# TAKEAWAYS:\n1. Self-rewarding language models can potentially reduce dependence on human-generated preference data.\n2. Fine-tuning models using direct preference optimization can improve their instruction following ability and self-rewarding capability.\n3. The proposed approach shows promising results in outperforming existing systems.\n4. Scalability and potential limitations in real-world scenarios need to be further explored.\n5. This research contributes to the development of models that can continually improve without extensive human intervention."}

are two main steps one is the self instruction creation the second one is the instruction following training so you have got Model T and you have got model t+1 so always remember the model t+1 uses the data and the rewards generated by Model T So Model T is like model zero and model one is M1 is Created from the data that is let's say created from model zero and what kind of data that it creates is the main thing so it tries to create a couple of things or at least the steps the first one is an instruction following step the second one is a self instruction creation step and uh and that is where the concept of AI feedback comes into picture and AI feedback data set AI F also will come into picture and if you are familiar with this channel uh you might have already seen that we have covered a different technique called RL a so rlf reinforcement learning from Human feedback is a technique where human beings sit read the question OT the response or score the response and then give it back and that goes back to the reward training for the model and using reinforcement learning the model is improved RL aif is taking the human out of the loop and then putting an AI there and to reward so this the paper also acknowledges like later in this paper you would also see that they would have acknowledge that there are techniques like RL a if that is already available where the model has been used as a as a reward uh you know the scoring mechanism but if you see here what is the model is creating so the model is first trying to create a couple of things one they're creating uh they're starting so the first thing is you have a base model you have a base base model and as you can see in the setup you have a base model and uh the model then what it tries to do is it tries to use a seed data for instruction fine tuning and this is the only place where human beings data is used like uh or I mean technically the base model also has got human data but this is this is where the human author examples are used and from that that is what they're calling as sft Baseline and from that is now you have a new set of data called EFT C data now what is EFT this is evaluation data so anytime uh if is create if is there uh the model m0 is used uh to create something new and that is how the EFT comes into picture that is the evaluation so I think it comes from if in itself so you can see here that this results in 1775 train and 531 evaluation and uh they're also looking at the distributions to make sure that these do not overlap so if you see here at the end you can see here so they have created a TSN it's a very popular technique to Cluster things so you have got the if data you have got the a data and then you have got the EFT data so the distribution the it shows that when the distribution of if and EFT are separate that means the the overlap is less so the concept of overfitting or leakage uh Benchmark breaking on all these things reduce so so this dist distribution good on them that they have managed to do it now how is it working so like we discussed like there is a seed model there is a set of new prompts that generates the responses and from that there is a new set of rewards that are created and then from that the preference pays are created and then there is an iterative DPO that creates the new model in itself and then it continues so m0 M1 then M2 and M3 and you can see how the responses are created so this is a sample prompt and it basically says okay review the user question add the response the main thing is okay conclude the score in this particular format and you can also give the score and what is like how do you score it so this is basically given to the model for it to give you the response and this is the llm as a judge prompt so this is how the llm as a judg is and if you see the model sequence the iterative training you have got the m0 the base model the llm base model the Lama 2 L 70 billion parameter model without any fine tuning at all initialized with llama sorry initialized with m0 or in this case Lama 2 70 billion then fine tuned on if and EFT C data during sft during the supervis fine tuning process they used the if instruction fine tuning data set and the evaluation fine tuning data set to make sure that the model is instruction fine tune and that is your M1 now that M1 initialized and then trained with AI F M1 data using DPO how is this AI F created and that is what is is this is the AI F comes from there and that is what is used to train the model and then you have got one more step of you creating an M3 so what they have figured out is that when you have this kind of models like from the base model the EFT plus if supervis fine tuning then the iteration 2 and the iteration 3 you could see the models win rate increases so you can see let's say this is the with the when you compare it with the sft Baseline this is the M1 model this is the M2 model and this is the M3 I feel like almost I'm dealing with Apple MacBook so you have got M1 M2 M3 and you can see that in every iteration the self reward win rate actually increases and you can also see here that uh if you have got different models this is on alpaka evil 2.0 data set so if you've got different models like GPD 4 0314 22.0 7 mistal medium 21.86 claw 2 and everything is below this so now honestly like this is something to be happy about but um I'm a little skeptical at this point because this is particularly looking at only one data set I'm still not very sure about how much of this is maybe an overfitting that we have not figured out I know that they have done distribution separately I know that they're showing that the over distribution doesn't overlap between if a and EFT so if and a actually overlaps which is like what you would expect because if is human generated data and aif is non-human generated data so the fact that these two are in the same distribution actually tells you that e is almost like if so which is a good thing e EFT stays outside of this distribution which is also a good thing because that's how you evaluate it but what is my concern is that whatever we are doing we at least this paper is primarily on only one data set I mean it's it's good to be happy I'm happy that we are going to take humans out of the equation but I'm not sure how much of this iterative development is either because there is something better happening or because alpaka evil 2.0 data set has something that you know maybe we couldn't have um figured out see I come from a classical machine learning background and a lot of times we have had like lot of you know interns and the beginners joining the company and then they would say that okay every time I I'm trying to add a new column and then train the model the model accuracy is increasing and that would always give me the skepticism to say that okay maybe you know what there is a noise that the model is trying to learn and that is what it is understanding a signal and it is ultimately overfitting so I'm not exactly sure whether it is overfitting here I'm happy that it is a self-rewarding model and the Improvement is happening but because it is improving at every single iteration that gives me a little bit of skepticism and that is exactly why I told you also to take the results with a pinch of salt because it's one evaluation Benchmark alpaka EOL 2.0 and it is the same model and which generates different um the a data set and then it kinds of uh you know dpos iteratively on it and the results are promising um I think the paper is promising everybody's been talking about it I think whenever you take humans out of equation uh there's a bunch of AI en who are very happy but um but how is it going to translate in real world is something that I'm definitely interested in learning about and if you have any questions please let me know in the comment section otherwise this is a very fun paper to read see you in another video Happy prom day \n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nThis paper introduces self-rewarding language models that use iterative direct preference optimization to improve instruction following and generate high-quality rewards.\n\n# MAIN POINTS:\n1. Large language models often struggle with alignment and value human values.\n2. The paper proposes a technique called direct preference optimization (DPO) to train models without relying on human-generated preference data.\n3. The method involves creating a seed model, generating new prompts and rewards, and iteratively fine-tuning the model using DPO.\n4. The approach outperforms existing systems on the alpaka evil 2.0 leaderboard in a preliminary study.\n5. The use of llm as a judge and self-rewarding models is not new, but this paper combines them to improve model performance.\n6. The self-rewarding models show improvement in both instruction following and reward generation abilities.\n7. The iterative training process leads to increased win rates at each iteration.\n8. The paper acknowledges potential limitations and scalability challenges of the approach in real-world scenarios.\n9. The evaluation is primarily based on the alpaka evil 2.0 dataset, which raises skepticism about potential overfitting.\n10. The paper offers a promising direction for models to continually improve without relying on human feedback.\n\n# TAKEAWAYS:\n1. Self-rewarding language models using direct preference optimization can improve instruction following and generate high-quality rewards.\n2.

caught my attention and a lot of people's attention and that paper is self rewarding self rewarding language models it is a paper from New York University and also meta AI why is this paper interesting is what I was trying to Del dive deeper into the main thing here is uh as the title suggests you might have already guessed it that this is a paper that talks about models rewarding itself so the concept reward comes from reinforcement learning but why is it interesting why is everybody talking about it the first reason is if you think about large language models people are building a lot of large language models and one problem is still there and that problem is alignment so how do you make these models as good as human beings or how do you make these models value human values this is the question that everybody has been trying to solve that is one of the biggest bottleneck in fact a lot of times open AA has been been blamed for lobotomizing the model by doing rlf reinforcement learning from Human feedback and in the last few weeks or I should say few months there is another very popular technique that has risen up to the level where rlf may not be very important it so that new technique is called DPW direct preference optimization so it has got a preference pair or a preference data set and based on which the model has been trained or aligned or fine tune so whatever that is the final stage is DPO now what this paper is trying to do is this paper is saying that you do not need humans at all even to generate the preference data set you can skip humans I mean a little bit of human is required for the SE data set but you can skip humans a rest of the process you can have model zero build model one based on it build model two based on it build model three based on it and this model three like let's say llama 2 70 billion parameter model would be as good as mral medium so this is a very huge claim and I want to dive deeper into how they go went about it and what this paper is suggesting first of all this is still experimental I don't see like a data or model for us to play with it so take it with a pinch of Sal so the first thing is what is this paper this is self-rewarding language models in this study or in this work they're talking about a self- rewarding language model where the language model itself is used as an llm as a judge and this is not the first time we are seeing llm as a judge llm as a judge is a very popular Concept in fact a lot of popular benchmarks use gp4 as a judge for example I think mty bench maybe if I'm right empty bench uses gp4 to ultimately score the llm responses so there are a lot of benchmarks and a lot of existing techniques that use one of the best models like gp4 to score the response so llm as judge is a very popular concept so they're using llm as as a judge prompting to provide its own rewards during the training so we show that iterative DPO direct preference optimization training not only does instruction following ability improve but also the ability to provide high quality rewards to itself this is the main impact the most important thing of this paper is that they figured out that the it's not only the instruction following ability improves but also to provide high quality rewards to it like to the model in itself so fine tuning Lama 2 70 billion on three iterations like I said m0 is the base model M1 M2 M3 of our approach yields a model that outperforms many existing systems on alpaka evil 2.0 leaderboard including claw 2 Gemini Pro and GPD 40613 the latest version I guess while only a preliminary study this work opens the door to the possibility of models that can continually improve in both axes now one thing to note is uh very later somewhere in this they also acknowledge that this system may not hold entirely true or may not scale up in the real world scenario because sometimes it might saturate see at the end of the day you are using a base model to reward or create instruction data set and then reward the model so how much it would scale in the real environment I think that is something that we need to see whether it is going to saturate whether you know after a point it just goes garbage in garbage out that is not something that we know yet but yeah we have a model that can do certain things how does it work there are two main steps one is the self instruction creation the second one is the instruction following training so you have got Model T and you have got model t+1 so always remember the model t+1 uses the data and the rewards generated by Model T So Model T is like model zero and model one is M1 is Created from the data that is let's say created from model zero and what kind of data that it creates

where the concept of AI feedback comes into picture and AI feedback data set AI F also will come into picture and if you are familiar with this channel uh you might have already seen that we have

can pass on a link of air table that contain a list of different research objects and they will be able to extract data from the air table research together and F in the results back to air table for me behind the scenes there is swamp of different gpts working together from breaking down the big research goal into prioritize list to actually browsing internet CRI tiet results to produce high quality research and what's more exciting is that you can actually expand this system to more and more different working groups to expand its ability further if you want and I want to show you step by step how I did it if you watch my videos before you probably know I'm very passionate about building an AI researcher because research is such a foundamental ability that AI can do and has a wide range of use case scenario and for the past 6 months the AI development has been so crative that every two months I re build a new AI researcher with a lot of new capabilities delivering higher and higher quality quity research back may 2023 it a simple lar language model chain that follow a very linear process it is basically a function that can take in a research topic triggering the Google research and let large language model to choose which links are most relevant and scripting the website and in the end get large langage model to generate a report I can type in topic of Twitter threat I want to write and it will do the research and generate a Str based on those information collected so even though it works but it is really linear flow for example if the new reference information found from the content script it won't be able to research further so it is only good for very obvious simple research tasks but two months later AI agent became a part topic and if you don't know what AI agent is it is combination of large language model memory and tools so it can do the reasoning to break down a big goal into sub tasks and also have access to different tools like Google search API to actually complete those tasks and also have long-term memory to remember what he did before and one of the most fundamental difference is that AI agent is more goal oriented so you can give a fairly ambiguous goal like research facts about what happened to Sam it is able to take multiple different actions to complete this goal so very quickly I build a second version of research agent where I give a special system prompt as well as access to basic tools like Google search and scripting and the quality of research result is a lot higher it is able to continuously navigating through the internet find more and more reference articles until point that it feels that it gots enough information and complet the tasks I can just give it ambiguous research go and it is able to return a high quality research results as well as a list of different reference links so it was a huge step forward compared with this first version of AI researcher but also has problems the biggest one is the quality is not consistent sometime it deliver awesome research results on the other hand it can't really handle complex or constraint actions that open AI didn't really want it to do so if I wanted to research about the phone number or email address about a specific perspect it kind of refused to do so so in summary it is great for a list of different tasks but the quality is not assured but after a few months a few multi-agent systems emerged like M gbt and Chad def it allowed the system to tackle more complex tasks they try to improve the task performance by introducing not only one but multiple agents working together and the recent Frameworks like autogen made the creation of those system even easier and it is very flexible to create all sorts of different hierarchy and structure to orchestrate the collaboration between different agents and as open AI released assistant API and GBS the cost of building useful agents has significantly dropped so this got me thinking why can't I create AI researcher 3.0 where I can have the original researcher to still doing the research but introduce a research manager to critique and do the quality control to making sure the result is always aligned with what user want and what's cooler is I can even introduce more and more agents into this assistant for example I can introduce another research director who can break down a large research goal into subtasks and delegate to both research manager and researchers and even do more tasks like reading and writing to a air table to save all the research results while the research team will be still focusing on doing the actual research and the result is the research quality is a lot more consistent and system becomes a lot more autonomous as well as all those little agents just doing the quality assurance with each other this represent paradigm shift about what people think of AGI at earlier this year when we talk about AGI often we have this image where this one AI can do all sorts of different things then the word might just have one AI that operates everything but there are lots of different technical challenges to get this work but on the other side the sentiment now is whether we can create lots of different agents who are specialized in specific task but figure out framework that let them collaborate towards a share goal but how do you train highly specialized agent well there are two common ways you can either do fine-tuning or you can create knowledge base which is what people normally call Rock retrieval augmented generation and they kind of serve different purpose rag is mainly used when you want to give large Lage model very accurate and rant data like get the most up to- dat stock information but if your goal is to improve the model skills in performing specific task like data categorization or answering customer email in specific style that's the time you want to try fine tuning but here's one problem fine tuning of high performance opens Source model is difficult and requires specialized Hardware with big memory capacity and Grading AI is a platform that really reduce barrier for fine tuning they make fine-tuning and influence open source model extremely simple and accessible to all developers and Enterprise with just few lines code you can find two model like llama 2 nors hermis and others you can also choose the programming language of your preference either nodejs python or command line interface and they provide all the tools and tutorials needed so you can get start very easily and the best is their pricing model normally for fine tuni you will have to pay all the upfront cost for dedicated infrastructure and Computing unit but gradient remove the need for the infrastructure and you only pay for what you use by token if you click on the link in the description below you will get $5 free credits to Stars so if you ever have needs to find your model but don't know how to start I definitely recommend to give a try and now back to our research agents I'm going to show you how can you build this multi agent research system step by step let's get it so the way we will Buu this system is our first it creat three different GPT assistants with different roles director research manager and research agent and each one of them play different role where director will be able to read and update air table database and also break down research task and delegate to research manager and researchers where the research manager will generate an actual research plan for a given topic and review and do the quality assurance for the actual research delivered by res Searcher and we're use autogen as a framework to oxr those collaborations and one good thing about using autogen is they actually simplify how to use assistant API because assistant API actually structure in a way that you have to create Strat send message wait and continuously check the progress to use that you normally need to create a function like this where it will create a run the Strat message first and write a function to continuously check the progress until you get progress like requir action to ask for user confirmation or send back reads but with Auto is pretty straightforward you can use a GPT assistant agent and just trigger message like normal so let's firstly create assistant open AI playground so I'll create a research agent first which agent that actually going to browse the internet and do the task so I'll given name special instructions your worldclass researcher who do detailed research on any topic and produce fact-based results you do not make things up and you should do enough research to gather as much information as possible if there are URL or relevant links and articles you will script it to get more information after each scripting and search you should think is there any other new things that I should search and script based on the data I have now but don't do this more than three iterations you should not make things up and in the final output it should include the research reference link as well and do not include a website like G2 LinkedIn because those S sometimes are gated or the quality or the content quality is not great I choose GPD for Turbo and then add two different function callings inside this is schema the name is Google search description and the input will be Search keywords and it is required the other is website scripting it would have two inputs one is the URL of the website that it should script another is objective which is the goal of scripting website because for scripting I will actually trigger a summary chain so I want a large Lage model to know what are the goal of This research so that they can summarize content in a way that then lose those details and the required is URL and objective and here I just turn on code interpreter in case you need to do some further data analyst and once you finish you can try it out let's say research about pricing model for relevance a a i and click add R so you can say it do a Google search first the Search keywords is ROM than sayi pricing model let's say I return example results of this URL then it will try to do the website scripting with this URL and also the objective extract detail information about pricing model including any tier rat or specific service feature included each price point so this is pretty good the next thing is our created research manager given name and also this special prompt so you are a research manager you're are harsh and relentless your firstly try to generate two actions the researcher can take to find information needed try to avoid websites that don't allow scraping and you review the results from researcher and always push back if the researcher didn't find the information be persistent say no you have to find the information try again and propose one next method to try if the research want to get away only after researcher found the information needed he will say terminate so this a researcher manager will basically play the role of quality control and making sure the researcher tried everything possible to find the information and click save and the last one is director and I will give you a special system prompt you are the director of research company you will extract list of companies to research from Air table and break it down into individual research task for each research task you will delegate to research manager and Market researcher to complete a task once a company's research is completed you will updated company information individually to air table and only say terminate after you update all the records in air table with information collected and it will have two different functions one is get air table records which will be used to read existing data on a from a air table URL and it has a few inputs base ID and table ID and the other is update single and the other is update single air table record it has other inputs base ID table ID as well as ID of the specific rode that I need to update and the data that to be updated and again I can test this one as well so I copy this link research the pricing model of each company in the list list so it will try to trigger the air table records with the exact base ID and table ID and let's say this is a list of Records in return and click submit then it will read the result and break down into different research task and delegate to research manager and Market researcher and let's say it Returns the research results and boom it trigger four different update single air table records so this is new parallel multi-function ability that open a I just introduced and as you can see it gets inputs all correctly so this is working well as well so now we get both stre assistant set up we just need to connect them together in autogen so I will open the visual studio code and firstly let's create new file called oei config list this is where your inst open AI API key putting array as well as a model and next let's create aemv file so this is where we store API key for other service like browser L and serer which is the one we're going to use for Google search and web scripting and also put open AI here that's because I actually want to use l chain summarized chain later to summarize content that agent script from website all right and next we will create app.py and first they import list of different libraries that we're going to use and also load environment and config list and now let's have overview about what we're going to create so we'll create a list of functions that we're going to use from website scripting Google search get and update air table records as well as four different agents we're going to create from user proxy agent researcher research manager and director and we're going to put them together into a group chat in the end start a conversation and firstly let's create a function for Google search and here we're going to use service called serer to get Google search results so give a URL keywords the API key and do a post request and next is function for website scripting and we will have two function one is the website scripting and summary function will be used if the content is too long so that we don't blow up agents memory and under the web scraping we're passing on two input objective and URL putting the header and data which is URL that we want to script and convert it to Json string so that we can pass on to the API request Quest and here we are using browser L which is website scraping service but for more sophiscated scraping Behavior you can also use API file or rapid API where they provide wide range of data access so I press on URL header and data and if we get response back and then we will try to extract Tex content from the website and if the lens is more than 10,000 character then we will do a summary otherwise it will just return the text and for summary function we're going to summarize it through a ling summary chain so I create large Dage model use text splitter to split the large content into small chunks with each chunk size 10,000 and I'm going to create list of documents from the split text and here I will give it a prompt write a summary of the following text for this specific objective and here a summary and I will create a map prompt template and use l chain low summarize chain so what this does is it basically try to make a summary of each chunk and in the end try to combine them together and then outp put final summary so those are all the function that we need for the research agent and then I move down here to define the user proxy agent and research agent to start test so first they\n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nDuring the weekend, the speaker built a multi-agent research system using GPT assistants for browsing, scripting, and quality control tasks.\n\n# MAIN POINTS:\n1. The initial version of the AI researcher was a linear process, limited to simple research tasks.\n2. The second version, an AI agent, could break down goals, access tools, and improve research quality.\n3. However, the quality of results was inconsistent and had limitations for complex tasks.\n4. Multi-agent systems like MGBT and Chad def emerged, allowing multiple agents to collaborate on complex tasks.\n5. Autogen made creating these systems easier, enabling collaboration and an autonomous research process.\n6. The speaker proposed creating AI Researcher 3.0, introducing a research manager for quality control and delegating tasks.\n7. More agents, like a research director, could be introduced to handle large research goals and read/write to external databases.\n8. The research quality becomes more consistent, and the system becomes more autonomous through agent collaboration.\n9. This represents a paradigm shift from a single, versatile AI to specialized agents collaborating towards shared goals.\n10. Gradient AI provides a platform to simplify fine-tuning and make it accessible for developers and enterprises.\n\n# TAKEAWAYS:\n1. Building a multi-agent research system can improve research quality and consistency.\n2. Autogen framework simplifies agent collaboration and communication.\n3. AI Researcher 3.0 with specialized agents allows for more complex tasks and quality control.\n4. Fine-tuning models using Gradient AI makes it easier and more accessible.\n5. Specialization and collaboration are key in achieving AGI, rather than relying on a single AI performing multiple tasks."}

autogen user proxy agent is basically agent that can execute code or give feedback to other agents on behalf of user and I will putu human input mode to be always so that I will always have chance to give feedback and next is we will create a researcher agent so our Define researcher agent equal to GPT assistant agent give name and researcher and inside lar langage model config I pass on the assistant ID and assistant ID is the one that I will get from the open AI playground also registered functions so web scripting function will be point to the web scripting function that we create above same thing for Google search so that's pretty much it it's super easy to set up and I can quickly test it out user proxy agent initial a CH research with the pricing of random Ai and our open Terminal try to run this and one thing to know is to run GPT assistant in Auto gen you have to install this specific version of autogen 0.2.0 B5 so making sure you install this first and then let's run python app.py so you can see the user proxy agent trigger message what's surprising then the researcher execute the Google search function and also start sripping and great so it return the results with all different tiers okay great so that means we successfully set up autogen with GPT assistance now we just need to bring more agents so I'll create a research manager agent same thing I'll go back to open AI copy the assistant ID and pting here so research manager agent is also ready and this research manager agent will review and critique the result from researcher which in series should really improve the quality of research so let's try out I'll quickly create a group chat with user proxy agent researcher and research manager and I trigger message to the group chat manager why Sam timman was fired so you can see it trigger message to chat manager and the researcher start browsing the internet and get information and here is the initial report there's some issues scripting the content from website however Sam atomus departure from open I follow with review process by the board which conclude that he was not consistently transparent in his communication with the board leading to the board lost confidence in his ability to lead the company and this pretty much this is fine but it's not great it's very like surface level information but then you can see the research manager he said no you have to find information try again there could be confusion or misinformation around this topic so first say check official press release or statement from open AI or Sam optiman himself and then look for credible new source or technology focused Publications so this is great it will force the researcher to do more research and also give advice about where to look and now the researcher coming back with more more and better details which is great so the last thing I want to do is I'll create director agent we should be able to access any air table link I have and conduct multiple different research actions and few information back so I will firstly move up to create a function for air table and we're use air table API and point and to do that you need to go to air table SLC create SL tokens to create a new token give a name and also add a scope which should both read and write permission and once it finish you should come back Tov file and include air table API key here as well so our first create function forget a table records so it will pass on base ID and table ID base ID is basically this part of the URL and table ID is this part of the URL and second is we will create a function for update single air table record where it will pass on API key and data will be records the ID of the row and also the fuse to update it will be a patch request call and that's pretty much it I'll move down to the create director agent our Define director agent with the specific assistant ID and also register the two functions for read and write at table in the end I will add director into the group chat so this you can see how easy it is to continue expanding this swamps so to continue expand the swamp of agents and our add a new message research the pricing for each company in the list with this air table so I'll trigger this message so you can see the director use the function to actually get the list of records from Air table and then create a message to research for each company uh it does hallucinate a little bit um probably to change the system prom a little bit now it is try to be creative and hallucinate about the different research manager it has and then the researcher start doing different type of Google search doing different different Google search and as you can see here it is triggering multiple search function at the same time and here are also update the system prompt for director agent as well so one thing I want to make it to do is making sure dat get task one by one do not delegate all task at once and after each research you have to update the research result individually to air table and then move on dedicate next research topic and the reason I do this is because the agent didn't have unlimited memory at this point and I notice that when there are a lot of items the agent can trigger a lot of different Google search at same time which actually reduce the research quality so I want to making sure the agent actually runs to research one by one and our give message research the funding stage amount and pricing for each company in the list and I'll open this to python app.py so you can see it Tred to GA records from Air table and then it says the first company to research is this one and the researcher start doing the research and the researcher has returned results about funding stage but it didn't really find the pricing so research manager push back and then say you can check the official Channel as well as second resource so the so researcher actually start doing more research and at second try is successfully get the pricing information as well and on the right you can see it automatically adding this information and then it start delegated for the next research topic which is ROMs Ai and you also get information for random AI to then move on to the last one stack Ai and eventually finish all the research and this is a pretty short list but you can imagine creating list of hundreds of research topics and this research team can just autonomously running for a while until they feel in the information for every single row there's still quite a bit problem is and there are still quite a bit problems the biggest one is memory because during the research stage there are quite a lot of information with script and often the researcher can forget the information he found before but there are ways you can customize that as well so autogen provide you ability to fully customize the group chat flow so you can even set up two teams with agent one should only have memory for certain information Agent B holds TRS about specific information so this is probably a good way to control the amount of memory for each agent and in my specific case the director probably should only know the final research output from the research manager instead of saying the whole conversation chain but the result is already pretty stunning I imagine this research agent can be used for sales and VC who want to do a lot of leads qualification so that's it for the AI researcher 3.0 it is really powerful and the only thing to be aware is that this can actually cost a lot of money so making sure you monitor your open AI bu and this is just one example as I mentioned you can actually create all sorts different hierarchy and collaboration workflow so I'm very excited to see those fully autonomous agent teams that you start building if you enjoy this content please consider give me a subscribe thank you and I see you next time \n", "response": "## ONE

feeding an opponent the feeling of getting ahead the feeling of winning but in this video I'm going to talk about my perspective on how focusing on winning most of the time actually is not optimal for winning and in the end of the video I'm going to talk about the few times it's reasonable to focus on winning first B everybody wants to win every athlete every team in every competition all of them wants to win so he can't be the main factor that differentiates winners from losers and James Clear talked about this too he had this great question if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day would you still get result I think you would he said and I agree if you played Sports you probably heard the saying the results will take care of itself the three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh said something similar the score takes care of itself it takes care of itself in other words focusing on winning doesn't matter because it will take care of itself focusing on winning is not included in the equation only thing that matters is that you focus on taking the ACT will get you the results winning is for shortterm and learning is for longterm to give you an example of this we'll talk about my experience with resilient ji Jitsu which is a fight sport this concept can be applied to all other areas the guy that focuses on winning is probably going to win more but that's only in the short term to learn something new to learn a new technique you will have to first put yourself in situations where you're able to apply that technique where you're able to learn that technique and by doing this you're risking putting yourself in situations where you will lose and you will fail and if you're the guy that focuses on winning you're not going to want to do this so you're not going to be able to learn new things and new techniques second of all the guy that focuses on winning is going to rely more on his strength than his technique a lot of the times in Brazilian jiu-jitsu you're going to be put in situations where you can either use more strength to submit someone or you can use better technique and if you're new using more strength probably going to be a higher percentage for you to finish or submit your opponent and because your focus is on winning you're going to use strength what you don't realize is that in the long term the guy that focused on better technique his submission rate is going to be way higher than yours because he has better technique and he hasn't even applied his full strength yet another concept that comes in when we talk about focusing on winning versus focusing on learning is the concept of external reward versus internal reward as I've said earlier the guy that focused on winning is probably going to win more in the short term in other words he's going to get more external rewards and he's going to think back to how he got this reward he got this reward by not putting himself in situations where he could lose and he got this reward by applying more strength than technique so he's going to continue to do those actions by winning and by getting external reward ironically he's going to reinforce bad actions and ultimately bad habits to become the guy that focuses more on learning you have to realize that if you managed to put yourself in situation where you were able to apply new techniques and learn you've actually won even though you might have lost that round even though externally it didn't look like you gain something you have to realize that you've won you have to internally reward yourself lastly let's talk about when I think it's reasonable to actually Focus winning first I think it's very reasonable to do it now and then just to feel what it's like feel what it is like to use 100% your strength and speed feel what what it's like to let your subconscious take care of your techniques while your conscious is 100% focused on winning the second time I think it's reasonable to focus on winning is in important competition note that I'm saying important competition and not all competition and to give you an example of this I participated in a Brazilian chitsu competition and my focus at that time was on winning as a consequence of that I went down at a weight class and I won't but looking back at it now I would have changed my focus to learning by focusing on learning I wouldn't have gone down a weight class I would have competed at a heavier and more competitive weight class even though my chance of winning would have gone down the reason I would have changed my focus to learning is because of that competition was really not that important and my future competitions are going to be more important and I would argue that the experience that I would have gotten from competing in a heavier more competitive weight class would have been of a lot more value than competing at a easier weight class even though I've [Music] won \n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nFocusing solely on winning in sports and competitions is not optimal for long-term success, as learning and growth are more important

to be one of the 91% of people who did not uh actually complete their New Year's resolutions and it was because I was setting my goals completely wrong I wasn't making progress I felt kind of stuck in my life I think part of the reason for that is that there's so many distractions nowadays and it's hard to stay focused on one thing for an entire year there's social media there's advertisements there's so many different things pulling us away it's so hard to stay focused for you know an hour much less a year and that's why I Tred some different goal setting methods and I found one that really really worked for me and it's setting 90-day goals which seems kind of simple um but I was setting my goals wrong and that's part of why I never got them achieved so in this video I wanted to share how I pick specific goals that I can actually achieve and stick with in my framework for actually choosing goals how I make a plan to hit that in the next 90 days how I break that down into weekly steps and then into daily steps and I get uh you know one thing done every day to get me closer to that goal and I almost can't help but achieve my goals when I break it down this way and some tips on how to stay consistent so you don't become part of the 91% of people that's a crazy step to start off with I ask myself a specific question and then I use a specific framework in order to answer that question so the question is the Dan Sullivan question which is if we're having a discussion 3 years from today and you were to look back over those 3 years to today what has to have happened both personally and professionally for you to feel happy about your progress now 3 years is a long time so I asked that same question but in a 90day timeline if I see myself as 90 days from now what has happened in these 90 days to make me feel like I was successful I got some stuff done I'm proud of myself I'm happy with where I'm at what has to have happened and then I use something called smart goals pretty much a smart goal is something that is specific measurable attainable relevant and time bound so for instance I could have a 90-day goal to get to half a million subscribers but that's a horrible goal cuz I can't control that instead I could have a goal of posting every single week and that would would get me closer to that or my specific goal for these next 90 days is to post 20 videos in the next 90 days which is more than one a week which I haven't really done in a couple years but that's something that I can control another one that I hear all the time is my goal is to get healthy this year I'm going to get in shape this year stupid goal instead you want something that is measurable I'm going to track my calories every single day I'm going to walk 10,000 steps a day I'm going to do something that is specific measurable attainable relevant and time bound I should probably find an actual tripod so before we get into the weekly and the daily this is how I set my main goal but there's a few steps after that I'm using the framework from this finishers journal and some kind of like things that I've learned over the past it's not a sponsored video uh I do have an affiliate link with like 15% off but I've literally used them every day for the past 2 years so um that's what you're going to be seeing in this video but I'm absolutely sure you could probably do the same thing with a piece of paper um for free do it on your phone do whatever this just helps me uh to kind of have it all written now so I start off with my outcome goal post 20 videos by X date then I break it down into actionable steps what are some steps that will get me closer to that goal for me it's to plan out the next 20 videos so I actually know what I'm supposed to be doing over these next 20 weeks so sitting down and doing that then it might be posting 10 videos by halfway through that way I know that I'm on track posting three day in the life videos cuz that'll help me do some extra ones on top of the normal ones let taking whatever your big goal is and breaking it down into actionable steps and each step has to be relevant to the big goal and then another thing that I've started doing over like the 6 months is to use a motivation my motivation for this is if I do it I'll be able to take an entire week off and not work which I haven't done in years I don't know if that's a motivation or punishment cuz I love what I do but I think it'll be good for me so I'm going to try it maybe for you it's buying a coat or taking a weekend away or it's donating to a campaign of somebody you absolutely disagree with so that way you really want to hit your goal cuz you're more scared of the punishment than you would be uh of a reward what's your motivation behind this it's important to keep that in mind if you want to actually stick with your goal generally I set one to two goals uh I would never go past three CU if you have a bunch of priorities you don't have any priorities so that's why I think it's good to set as few goals as possible so you can be laser focused and actually achieve them so next up we have our weekly goals it's pretty simple pretty much write down the most important thing for the week that if you got that done you would feel like that week was a success one thing that will make a huge impact and then if you have other things that are kind of underneath that you list them out underneath that and you use the ABC method the ABC method is pretty much write down ABCD e FG whatever it is on however many you have on that list of secondary tasks and you do them in that order most important a least important C that way obviously it seems small and easy but we have a tendency to do the unimportant things first and to leave off the other stuff so that's why I love having that most important thing and then everything else and even that everything else is in order so that if you're not going to do something at least it's going to be something that wasn't that important anyways so usually on Friday I'll do this where I will plan out my next week and then I'll also review the previous week I'll look at what worked what I should keep doing I'll look at what didn't work and what I should probably cut out a little bit how I can improve anything that I learned maybe and then I'll go back and look at my overall goal kind of make some notes on there and this is really just a way to keep yourself on track cuz if you don't look at your overall goal for like a month you're going to forget about it you're going to lose motivation so if you keep thinking about it every week and seeing it you're much much much more likely to actually achieve it so now we're at what I think is the most important part which is the daily I love this I mentioned this book a while ago which is the one thing which is just doing one thing every day to get you closer to your goals this is how I do that for the past couple years this is how I've been doing it I I lost a couple but I have a bunch left every single day doing one thing to get me closer to my goals it's amazing so I start off with my priority task we'll use today as an example today my task to get me closer to the 20 goals was to shoot a 90day video going over me actually going through through this which I've been doing cuz today is New Year's then I had some secondary tasks I need to edit this video I think I'm going to edit it myself cuz uh I I really enjoy editing then I have to answer some emails and that's my entire to-do list for today most important thing I've already done second most important thing I'm about to do third thing if it doesn't get done it's whatever on days where I have more going on I'll have additional tasks but I really like keeping it really simple that if I got done just shooting this video today I would feel like it was a success for every goal it's going to be different but if you get down that one thing you're okay with burning the rest of the list then another thing that I've been using a lot recently is time boxing which again you can do on your calendar you can do on a piece of paper I just use this journal but I time box when I'm going to shoot when I'm going to edit answer emails then I'm not actually doing anything the rest of the day but at least it's planned out it's in order most important to least important I I know when I'm going to do them and then generally every uh night or whenever I wrap up my day I will plan out the next day instead of trying to do that in the morning when I've got a bunch of stuff that I'm thinking about that way I can just wake up and get right to work and know exactly what I'm supposed to be doing so for me that's been a great way to kind of wrap up your day now if you're starting to start a habit at the beginning of this year I'd recommend getting like a calendar or print out where this journal uh has one of these and just keeping track of every day that you do whatever you're supposed to do maybe it's walking 5,000 steps tracking your calories not going on your phone for the first couple hours of the day journaling every morning reading 15 pages a day whatever your thing is actually have it visible written down somewhere and checking it off every single day and then use this two-day rule it's okay if you miss one day just never miss two days in a row that's how people fall off diets they quit their businesses they do everything that they hate doing and they wish they didn't do because they missed one day and they're like ah well well it's just one more day and then it's like well maybe I'll just I'll pick it up Monday that seems like a good ide and then Monday comes around and it's like you know what I'm already this far it's too late to catch up now just never miss two days in a row that one idea has completely changed my life just try that uh if you guys want to check out finisher Journal getting on a sponsor 15% off the link down below I absolutely love them you can also just use a piece of paper uh but this helps me like get way more done so \n", "response": "# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\n\nSetting 90-day goals with specific,

is an AI application that can help assist in creating AI agents with the drag and drop user interface many loved it and thought it would be really useful which got me researching for similar tools but that are completely open- source that is where I stumbled across an open source tool that replicates n introducing xforce IDE a really new project that was actually just recently released just yesterday today it's a very simple open- Source UI that helps you create agent based workflows for yourself just drag and drop agents connect them together give them a specific task and run it on your local desktop just take a look at this example which shows how you can create multiple AI agents with different custom agents this is a tool that allows you to easily create conversible agents executable agents as well as customizable agents we got some great news coming out of the patreon page as we have a couple more subscriptions being given out this month now this month we had a total of four different subscriptions being given out to our patreons and this just shows how unique and how amazing this community is we've been focusing really really hard on providing you guys with the best content as well as the best applications for free for just simply joining our patreon page you not only access subscriptions but you access resources collaboration networking opportunities and so much more definitely take a look at the patreon link in the description below if you want to access our private Discord this is quite an amazing tool that will be really beneficial for a lot of AI users who are quite new and do not have the right coding knowledge to create and deploy AI agents throughout today's video I'll be showcasing how you can get started with xforce demonstrate how you can create your own AI agency by using it as well as so much more so with that thought guys stay tuned and let's get straight into the video If you would like to book a one-on-one with me where you can access my Consulting Services where I can help you grow your business or basically give you a lot of different types of solutions with AI definitely take a look at the calendar Link in the description below hey what is up guys welcome back to another YouTube video at the world of AI in today's video we're going to be taking a look at xforce IDE this is a low code framework that operates as an agent as a service and it provides a friendly user interface which you can see right over here it's for creating agent-based workflows now the key feature revolving around xforce ID is its Dragon drop interface many of us love this drag and drop interface as we saw it with n as well as with flow wise this allows anyone to design workflows without the need of for extensive coding now once the desired workflow is created you can basically export it as a python script which can enable the execution of these Workforce on their own local machine it's something that makes xforce ID a userfriendly tool for individuals who want to develop AI agents without requiring Advanced programming skills this is something that I'll be showcasing as we go further into the video and this is something that you can actually access right away on the web now let's just take a look at some examples so you get a better idea as to what you can actually create with this framework now in this case you're able to compare the year-to-date gain between stocks this was an AI agent that was created using xforce and we can see that the initial prompt over here is where the user is initiating a conversation with xforce and it's asking for the current date for the stock prices of meta as well as Tesla like the year-to date gains and this is where they generated the script for this based off this flow over here you use the open AI model you set the API key use an assistant agent as well as a user proxy to help process this this is the initial prompt that is sent and the assistant agent is processing the open AI API which is then fusing these two nodes together into a group chat which is then going to generate the script now as we go down we can see that this is the initial prompt what date is today compare the year-to date gain for meta and Tesla now this is where xforce AI generates this python script and this is in response to this query that was sent to it it Imports the date time module to work with the dates as well as retrieving the current date using the datetime data data I believe command over here which is the print and this is where the placeholder values are set for the year to year-to date gains for meta as well as Tesla and as we go down further we can see that the execution is then set where it gives permission for the assistant to execute the generated python script it'll run the script and provide the output and this is where we see this output being generated you're also able to get this output that showcases that on January 20th of 2024 it states that Tesla has a higher year-to-date gain and if we go down even more it showcases this further in detail and this is based off the place sort of holder value now that's basically it for this example where you're able to create this comparison bot that compares the year-to date gain between the two stocks let's take a look at another example which is focusing on a research agent workflow and this is to find product ideas from latest research papers from archive now this is where we first start off with the initial prompt this is where you're instructing xforce AI to find the latest research paper about gb4 on archive and then identify potential applications of gbt 4 in software now this is where you're using the open AI API and it's being sent to the assistant agents which will then execute this user proxy prompt which is to find this latest paper about gb4 Etc and it's all fused into a group chat which will then be executable now this is where we then first start off with the generation of the code and that's using python script this is where the assistant will be then finding a way to simulate coder roles and it will generate a python script to achieve this task the script is using the archive API to search for papers and it's containing different types of content of GPT 4 in their title or even their abstract and this case they're going to sparse the responses where it's going to track the different types of information about the latest paper and it will print this information into that sparse chunk now the assistant is something that is going to acknowledge the identification of different types of potential applications in software and this will be a manual task and this will actually require human intervention to examine the abstract now once this is done you will then be sent to the execution where it will attempt and find different types of errors and through this process as we see over here you can keep keep on moving down and it will then showcase that if there's no errors it can then install and rerun this overall and then after there's a successful execution after solving all sorts of Errors we can then go to the conclusion which is going to then simulate the product manager where it will then showcase how xforce will be able to generate code so that it finds the responses of different types of uh gb4 archives as well as and execute this prompt where it will find the latest papers on gbt 4 so let's get started now this is our workspace where we're going to be using it to create specific agent workforces and this could be for custom business logic could be for executable agents customizable agents and such forth now there's four main Concepts revolving around the agents there's the assistant agent which is a subass of the conversational agent it allows for configuration of system prompts secondly you have this GP PT assistant agent this is based off of Open AI assistant API and it will enable for connections to open AI assistants in this overall xforce workflow you have the user proxy which is the proxy that acts between the agent Workforce as well as the user it's going to facilitate more feedback you have the group chat and that's something that will be enabling the collaboration amongst different agents as well as putting your own human intervention to working on specific tasks by connecting them together in that same group now there's also different types of tools and you can see that this is the agents you have the tool sets over here which is the custom function and this is a node in the tool category which will basically allow you to add custom python functions for agents to actually consume this is powerful for extending the functionality of xforce now it's just great to me like it's just great to understand that this is just a start for xort as this was just recently released on Twitter and I stumble across it and I have huge props for the developer who created this it's something that was just recently released and it's something that will be built upon even further now this is just the first day of this and I truly believe that it will be built further and extended upon now I forgot to mention about configuration and this is another core Library panel this is the setting to connect different large language models to agents now at this moment I believe it's only open AI which is something that will be tweaked upon further you can probably work with different open AI models but later on I believe they will have the ability to infuse different open- Source models so definitely stay tuned on that I can post about it more on the private Discord as well so if you're interested definitely check out the patreon page if you want to get more ideas as to when they will configure this further extend it further as well as if you want me to do more tutorials on it so if you see over here you can click on follow you can create your own project you're also able to export this which I'll talk about after but in this case we're going to create a new file and once this is done you can then start your new project this is where you can first start off by implementing your llm this is going to be your model provider so you can use gbt 4 Turbo or the ones that are stated over here in this case we're going to use gbt 4 input our API key and proceed forward now the group chat is the one that we talked about where we're going to be focusing on the subass of conversational agents you're also going to talk about the user proxy this is where we're going to input our prompt which is going to state to state the agent to basically work on that prompt you're going to also need to have an GPT assistant agent which is something that I'm going to be working on showcasing as we go further into this workspace but I'm just going to briefly create my own AI agent to do something and I'll be right back now I finally created my own AI agent with this in this case I have set my AI model as GPT 4 I created a GPT assistant agent which is built on the open AI API and it's going to help easily integrate any sort of a open AI assistant into this workflow I'm using an assistant agent node which is going to be the agent that will configure my overall system prompt now the system prompt that I gave this is that create me a web Scrapper application that will find me the most relevant information on the web now this this is where I'm like having it work alongside with the assistant agent that will then break down the findings and find the best script that is needed to basically create this web Scrapper application now this is now then being sent over to the group chat and this is where it's going to then process everything Al together and as we see it's a subass of conversible agent configured with a default system message which is the one that we saw with the user proxy now once you like what you have created you can then export it over to Python and we can see over here as you go down you can then start running your workflow and this is where you need to export it to your python code this is where you can then easily click on export and click on python code download the python file and then you can then upload it onto your IDE and start working with it right away now you're also able to run it on your local machine and they go through a step-by-step process as the how you can get started but you're going to need to make sure that you have piut autogen so make sure you have that you're also going to need to make sure that you have a virtual environment like condo or Petry so this is something that you should definitely take a look at on their xforce notion site which will demonstrate how you can start doing this more in detail how you can get started with xforce but that's basically it guys for today's video this is a simple demonstration as to how you can create your own uh AI agent with this ID on the web but with that thought guys thank you guys so much for watching I really really appreciate it I'll leave all the links as to what I used in today's video in the description below make sure you follow the patreon page if you want to access our private Discord make sure you follow us on Twitter if you guys haven't already so you can stay out to date with the latest AI news lastly make sure you check out our YouTube channel if you guys haven't already make sure you guys subscribe turn on the notification Bell like this video and check out our previous videos so you can stay up to date with the latest AI news but with that thought guys thank you guys so much for watching have an amazing day spread positivity and I'll see you guys fairly shortly peace out fellas \n", "response":

The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages\nis associated with the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes [ 2,3].\nNon-caloric AS (NCAS) have been recommended for weight manage-\nment and as a treatment strategy for type 2 diabetes [ 4]. While AS are\ngenerally considered safe with acceptable daily intake by regulatory\nagencies (e.g., European Food Safety Authority, US Food and Drug\nAdministration), mounting epidemiological evidence shows that the\nconsumption of AS is associated with the risk of cardiometabolic dis-\nease [ 2,3,5]. Moreover, due to the large consumption, AS are emerging\ncontaminants in aquatic environments with concentrations exceeding\n100 \u03bcg/L [ 6\u20138]. Therefore, a few controversies about AS need to be\naddressed, and both short- and long-term health effects of AS should be\nre-evaluated [ 2,5].\nThe ecotoxicity of AS at environmentally relevant concentrations has\nbeen investigated in several aquatic organisms [ 8\u201310]. For example, both\nthe physiology and locomotive behavior of crustaceans can be affected by\nsucralose exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations of0.5\u2013500\n\u03bcg/L [ 9]. Further studies in animal models and humans have\nshown that AS can act as potential endocrine disruptors with various\nadverse effects by modifying hormone levels and metabolism [ 8,10].\nThus, the continuous accumulation of AS in the environment requires\ncomprehensive investigations to explore the distribution and fate of AS\nand their human and environmental risks.\nThe gut microbiome plays an important role in food digestion,\nimmunomodulation, maintenance of structural integrity of the gut\nmucosal barrier, and xenobiotic and drug metabolism [ 11]. The dysbiosis\nof our normal gut microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of various\nmetabolic disorders [ 11]. Some in vivo andin vitro studies, observational\nstudies, and randomized clinical trials have provided insights into the\nassociation of gut microbiota perturbations with the consumption of AS\n[12\u201318]. An early study by Suez et al. [ 13] revealed that NCAS con-\nsumption induced glucose intolerance in mice, and the positivecorrelations between NCAS consumption and several metabolic charac-\nteristics (e.g., higher fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin)\nwere observed in non-diabetic individuals. Signi \ufb01cant correlations exist\nbetween microbial taxa (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae family, Deltaproteo-\nbacteria class, Actinobacteria phylum) and NCAS consumption. Both the\nantibiotic treatment and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from\nNCAS-consuming mice to germ-free mice supported that the effects of\nNAS were mediated by the alteration of gut microbiota. However, some\ncontradictory results have been observed, especially in human studies\n[14\u201319]. For example, Serrano et al. [ 17] performed a double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled, and parallel-arm study involving 46 healthy adults\nto investigate the effects of high-dose NCAS (saccharin) on gut micro-\nbiota and glucose tolerance. In contrast to the glucose intolerance re-\nported by Suez et al. [ 13], no altered glucose or hormonal responses were\nobserved during the oral glucose tolerance test in the subjects with NCAS\nconsumption, and no alterations in microbial diversity or composition\nwere observed. As known, the inter-individual variabilities of gut\nmicrobiota have been shown to affect host responses to dietary in-\nterventions or therapeutics [ 20,21]. The differences in the study design\n(e.g., control groups), microbiota at the baseline, dietary patterns, anti-\nbiotic treatments, medications, and other related confounding factors\ncould strongly in \ufb02uence the observations of gut microbial diversity and\ncompositions, which requires well-designed and data-rich clinical trials.\nRecently, Suez et al. [ 22] investigated the effects of oral supple-\nmentation with non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) on the microbiome and\nglycemic responses in 120 healthy subjects in the short term. In contrast\nto their previous study [ 13], a stringent screening protocol was applied to\nonly include complete NNS abstainers according to a food frequency\nquestionnaire based on NNS-containing foods or beverages in the Israeli\nmarket, which \ufb01nally recruited 120 participants from 1,375 healthy in-\ndividuals for eligibility. Four NNS intervention arms with saccharin,\nsucralose, aspartame, and stevia, as well as a control arm with glucose,\nwere used in this randomized-controlled trial with 20 subjects per arm.\nImportantly, the consumption of NNS was at a dose lower than the\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: boyangji@gmail.com (B.

Moreover, an additional control group with 20\nhealthy subjects without supplementation was evaluated. Altogether, the\n14-day NNS intervention was preceded and followed by a 7-day obser-\nvation phase, during which a series of anthropometric (i.e., body mass\nindex [BMI], HbA1c), clinical (i.e., continuous glucose monitor, glucose\ntolerance test) and biological measurements (i.e., oral and fecal micro-\nbiome, plasma metabolome) were performed at pre-determined time\npoints.\nAlthough extensive inter-individual variations of glucose tolerance\nchanges were observed, each NNS intervention showed distinct longi-\ntudinal pro \ufb01les of glucose tolerance. The supplementation of saccharin\nand sucralose impaired glucose tolerance in the healthy subjects, while\naspartame and stevia showed neutral effects on glucose tolerance when\ncompared against the glucose vehicle or non-supplementation groups.\nMoreover, saccharin and sucralose signi \ufb01cantly elevated glycemic\nresponse during the intervention. Metagenomic analysis showed signif-\nicant effects of saccharin and sucralose on the gut microbiota, whereas all\nNNS had signi \ufb01cant effects on microbial functions, such as purine\nmetabolism, glycolysis, polyamine metabolism, and fatty acid biosyn-\nthesis. Based on correlations between microbial features at baseline and\nthe glycemic response at the 2nd week of intervention, signi \ufb01cant con-\ntributions of microbiome to the variation of glucose tolerance, at least for\nthe sucralose group, were revealed. A following plasma metabolomics\nanalysis identi \ufb01ed differential metabolites and corresponding enriched\npathways, which were in accordance with the correlation between mi-\ncrobial metabolic pathways and elevated glycemic response.\nTo evaluate the causal roles of the gut microbiome for glucose intol-\nerance, FMT experiments were conducted to transfer stool microbiome\nfrom top/bottom responders in each group into germ-free mice. The top\nresponders were classi \ufb01ed by the potent glycemic responses, while the\nbottom responders had the lowest responses in the respective group. Both\nstool samples from the baseline and the end of the intervention were used\nfor FMT. Impaired glycemic responses were observed in mice humanized\nwith stool samples from NNS consumption top responders (at the end of\nintervention), while the mice colonized with samples from controls did\nnot show signi \ufb01cant effects on glucose tolerance. The following meta-\ngenomic analysis in mice showed doner-speci \ufb01c variations in glycemic\nresponses. Together, it provides evidence of the causal links between\nNNS-mediated microbial alterations and glucose intolerance.\nIn summary, Suez et al. [ 22] demonstrated the individual-dependent\nimpacts of NNS on the human gut microbiome in short-term in-\nterventions and established the causal roles of the microbiome in gly-\ncemic responses by FMT. It advances our understanding of the\nmicrobiota \u2013diet interactions in the healthy population and provides the\npossibility to predict potential glycemic responses at the individual level\n[22,23]. The participants included in Suez et al. \u2019s study [ 22] were mainly\nyoung and middle-aged adults with a median age of 29.95. It will be\nparticularly interesting to study the effects of AS with a much wider range\nof age groups since the sweet taste preference and sensitivity are signif-\nicantly different between age groups [ 24]. Although no signi \ufb01cant\nbaseline differences were found between intervention groups, including\nweight, BMI, smoking, and other related clinical parameters, it is un-\nknown how subtle variance of the baseline characteristics in \ufb02uences the\neffects of AS on gut microbiota after intervention at the individual level.\nConsidering the variance of gut microbiota between individuals of\ndifferent demography, ethnicity, gender, age, dietary patterns, and life-\nstyle, a well-designed study cohort and the choices for data analysis are\nparticularly important for controlling confounding effects. In the future,\nscale-up of the study population and enriching the data collection may\nthus provide foundations for the precision control of gut microbiome.\nCurrent clinical trials examined the long-term effects of AS, showing a\nstrong association between AS and increased risk of cardiometablic disease\n[2,3,5]. However, the published studies only investigate the short-term\neffects of AS on human gut microbiota, and clinical trials investigating\nthe long-term effects of AS on human gut microbiome have not been\nperformed [ 22,24]. The \ufb01ndings in these short-term studies stronglysuggest that further explorations studying the long-term effects of AS on\nthe human gut microbiome are recommended. Moreover, most of these gut\nmicrobiota studies did not investigate the fate of AS during the interven-\ntion, and whether the in vivo AS dynamics are associated with the\nshort-term responses remains unknown. The design of clinical trials with in\nvivoAS measurements could be performed to con \ufb01rm the responses of gut\nmicrobiota to AS interventions. In addition, current studies focused on the\ngut microbiota alternations in healthy populations. The information about\nthe effects of AS on individuals \u2019gut microbiota in populations with dia-\nbetes or cardiometabolic diseases are missing. Thus, extrapolation of the\nAS effects on the gut microbiome to diabetes/cardiovascular disease pa-\ntients by controlled trials is of great interest.\nIt should be noted that AS are usually used to replace caloric sugars,\nwhich may reduce the overall caloric intake. In several clinical trials, the\ndose of AS used was lower than the acceptable daily intake with glucose\nas a bulking agent. In everyday life, AS are usually consumed together\nwith caloric sugars. Moreover, individuals may simultaneously consume\nmultiple types of AS from different foods or beverages. Therefore,\ninvestigating the effects of AS with different doses, the combination ef-\nfects of AS, or the combinations of AS with different types of carbohy-\ndrates (e.g., fructose, sucrose, \ufb01bers) would give clues of AS effects from a\nreal-life view [ 25]. In addition, AS are emerging contaminants in aquatic\nenvironments. The consequences of long-term exposure to AS with\nenvironmental concentrations are not available, which require system-\natical analysis with animal experiments, observational studies, and\ncontrolled trials.\nAlthough current clinical studies have established the causal links\nbetween AS, gut microbiota, and health, the mechanisms through which\nAS can affect gut microbiota or the human body are unknown. Since most\nnon-nutritive AS are not metabolized, whether there are direct in-\nteractions between AS and gut microbial organisms is still unclear. The\nutilization of in vitro microbial cultures and synthetic microbiota may\nprovide an ef \ufb01cient/direct way to investigate the responses of gut mi-\ncrobial species to AS. With state-of-the-art organoid methods, the intes-\ntinal organoid cocultures with microorganisms will enable the\nmechanistic study of AS-microbe-host interactions with precise experi-\nmental control.\nRecent controlled clinical trials have shown personalized responses of\nhumans to AS. Analyzing the personalized data with arti \ufb01cial intelligence\nmay provide a basis to develop computational tools for precise prediction\nof glycemic responses, which can be integrated into current weight\nmanagement algorithms for personalized suggestions of AS usage. When\nthe baseline characteristics are integrated with the gut microbiota fea-\ntures, dietary patterns, lifestyle, and medication histories, it may be\npossible to predict the metabolic dynamics of individuals and provide\nhealthy dietary nutrition recommendations, which will help control\ndiabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the future, the application of such\na personalized longitudinal multi-omics approach with arti \ufb01cial intelli-\ngence may pave the way to understanding the links between metabolic\ndisease developments and the long-term effects of AS.\nAuthor contributions\nY.J.W.: conceptualization, investigation, writing; B.B.J.: conceptual-\nization, supervision, writing.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare no con \ufb02icts of interest.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was funded the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina (No. 32111530179).

The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages\nis associated with the incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes [ 2,3].\nNon-caloric AS (NCAS) have been recommended for weight manage-\nment and as a treatment strategy for type 2 diabetes [ 4]. While AS are\ngenerally considered safe with acceptable daily intake by regulatory\nagencies (e.g., European Food Safety Authority, US Food and Drug\nAdministration), mounting epidemiological evidence shows that the\nconsumption of AS is associated with the risk of cardiometabolic dis-\nease [ 2,3,5]. Moreover, due to the large consumption, AS are emerging\ncontaminants in aquatic environments with concentrations exceeding\n100 \u03bcg/L [ 6\u20138]. Therefore, a few controversies about AS need to be\naddressed, and both short- and long-term health effects of AS should be\nre-evaluated [ 2,5].\nThe ecotoxicity of AS at environmentally relevant concentrations has\nbeen investigated in several aquatic organisms [ 8\u201310]. For example, both\nthe physiology and locomotive behavior of crustaceans can be affected by\nsucralose exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations of0.5\u2013500\n\u03bcg/L [ 9]. Further studies in animal models and humans have\nshown that AS can act as potential endocrine disruptors with various\nadverse effects by modifying hormone levels and metabolism [ 8,10].\nThus, the continuous accumulation of AS in the environment requires\ncomprehensive investigations to explore the distribution and fate of AS\nand their human and environmental risks.\nThe gut microbiome plays an important role in food digestion,\nimmunomodulation, maintenance of structural integrity of the gut\nmucosal barrier, and xenobiotic and drug metabolism [ 11]. The dysbiosis\nof our normal gut microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of various\nmetabolic disorders [ 11]. Some in vivo andin vitro studies, observational\nstudies, and randomized clinical trials have provided insights into the\nassociation of gut microbiota perturbations with the consumption of AS\n[12\u201318]. An early study by Suez et al. [ 13] revealed that NCAS con-\nsumption induced glucose intolerance in mice, and the positivecorrelations between NCAS consumption and several metabolic charac-\nteristics (e.g., higher fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin)\nwere observed in non-diabetic individuals. Signi \ufb01cant correlations exist\nbetween microbial taxa (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae family, Deltaproteo-\nbacteria class, Actinobacteria phylum) and NCAS consumption. Both the\nantibiotic treatment and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from\nNCAS-consuming mice to germ-free mice supported that the effects of\nNAS were mediated by the alteration of gut microbiota. However, some\ncontradictory results have been observed, especially in human studies\n[14\u201319]. For example, Serrano et al. [ 17] performed a double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled, and parallel-arm study involving 46 healthy adults\nto investigate the effects of high-dose NCAS (saccharin) on gut micro-\nbiota and glucose tolerance. In contrast to the glucose intolerance re-\nported by Suez et al. [ 13], no altered glucose or hormonal responses were\nobserved during the oral glucose tolerance test in the subjects with NCAS\nconsumption, and no alterations in microbial diversity or composition\nwere observed. As known, the inter-individual variabilities of gut\nmicrobiota have been shown to affect host responses to dietary in-\nterventions or therapeutics [ 20,21]. The differences in the study design\n(e.g., control groups), microbiota at the baseline, dietary patterns, anti-\nbiotic treatments, medications, and other related confounding factors\ncould strongly in \ufb02uence the observations of gut microbial diversity and\ncompositions, which requires well-designed and data-rich clinical trials.\nRecently, Suez et al. [ 22] investigated the effects of oral supple-\nmentation with non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) on the microbiome and\nglycemic responses in 120 healthy subjects in the short term. In contrast\nto their previous study [ 13], a stringent screening protocol was applied to\nonly include complete NNS abstainers according to a food frequency\nquestionnaire based on NNS-containing foods or beverages in the Israeli\nmarket, which \ufb01nally recruited 120 participants from 1,375 healthy in-\ndividuals for eligibility. Four NNS intervention arms with saccharin,\nsucralose, aspartame, and stevia, as well as a control arm with glucose,\nwere used in this randomized-controlled trial with 20 subjects per arm.\nImportantly, the consumption of NNS was at a dose lower than the\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: boyangji@gmail.com (B.

Moreover, an additional control group with 20\nhealthy subjects without supplementation was evaluated. Altogether, the\n14-day NNS intervention was preceded and followed by a 7-day obser-\nvation phase, during which a series of anthropometric (i.e., body mass\nindex [BMI], HbA1c), clinical (i.e., continuous glucose monitor, glucose\ntolerance test) and biological measurements (i.e., oral and fecal micro-\nbiome, plasma metabolome) were performed at pre-determined time\npoints.\nAlthough extensive inter-individual variations of glucose tolerance\nchanges were observed, each NNS intervention showed distinct longi-\ntudinal pro \ufb01les of glucose tolerance. The supplementation of saccharin\nand sucralose impaired glucose tolerance in the healthy subjects, while\naspartame and stevia showed neutral effects on glucose tolerance when\ncompared against the glucose vehicle or non-supplementation groups.\nMoreover, saccharin and sucralose signi \ufb01cantly elevated glycemic\nresponse during the intervention. Metagenomic analysis showed signif-\nicant effects of saccharin and sucralose on the gut microbiota, whereas all\nNNS had signi \ufb01cant effects on microbial functions, such as purine\nmetabolism, glycolysis, polyamine metabolism, and fatty acid biosyn-\nthesis. Based on correlations between microbial features at baseline and\nthe glycemic response at the 2nd week of intervention, signi \ufb01cant con-\ntributions of microbiome to the variation of glucose tolerance, at least for\nthe sucralose group, were revealed. A following plasma metabolomics\nanalysis identi \ufb01ed differential metabolites and corresponding enriched\npathways, which were in accordance with the correlation between mi-\ncrobial metabolic pathways and elevated glycemic response.\nTo evaluate the causal roles of the gut microbiome for glucose intol-\nerance, FMT experiments were conducted to transfer stool microbiome\nfrom top/bottom responders in each group into germ-free mice. The top\nresponders were classi \ufb01ed by the potent glycemic responses, while the\nbottom responders had the lowest responses in the respective group. Both\nstool samples from the baseline and the end of the intervention were used\nfor FMT.

Signi \ufb01cant correlations exist\nbetween microbial taxa (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae family, Deltaproteo-\nbacteria class, Actinobacteria phylum) and NCAS consumption. Both the\nantibiotic treatment and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from\nNCAS-consuming mice to germ-free mice supported that the effects of\nNAS were mediated by the alteration of gut microbiota. However, some\ncontradictory results have been observed, especially in human studies\n[14\u201319]. For example, Serrano et al. [ 17] performed a double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled, and parallel-arm study involving 46 healthy adults\nto investigate the effects of high-dose NCAS (saccharin) on gut micro-\nbiota and glucose tolerance. In contrast to the glucose intolerance re-\nported by Suez et al. [ 13], no altered glucose or hormonal responses were\nobserved during the oral glucose tolerance test in the subjects with NCAS\nconsumption, and no alterations in microbial diversity or composition\nwere observed. As known, the inter-individual variabilities of gut\nmicrobiota have been shown to affect host responses to dietary in-\nterventions or therapeutics [ 20,21]. The differences in the study design\n(e.g., control groups), microbiota at the baseline, dietary patterns, anti-\nbiotic treatments, medications, and other related confounding factors\ncould strongly in \ufb02uence the observations of gut microbial diversity and\ncompositions, which requires well-designed and data-rich clinical trials.\nRecently, Suez et al. [ 22] investigated the effects of oral supple-\nmentation with non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) on the microbiome and\nglycemic responses in 120 healthy subjects in the short term. In contrast\nto their previous study [ 13], a stringent screening protocol was applied to\nonly include complete NNS abstainers according to a food frequency\nquestionnaire based on NNS-containing foods or beverages in the Israeli\nmarket, which \ufb01nally recruited 120 participants from 1,375 healthy in-\ndividuals for eligibility. Four NNS intervention arms with saccharin,\nsucralose, aspartame, and stevia, as well as a control arm with glucose,\nwere used in this randomized-controlled trial with 20 subjects per arm.\nImportantly, the consumption of NNS was at a dose lower than the\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: boyangji@gmail.com (B.

Moreover, an additional control group with 20\nhealthy subjects without supplementation was evaluated. Altogether, the\n14-day NNS intervention was preceded and followed by a 7-day obser-\nvation phase, during which a series of anthropometric (i.e., body mass\nindex [BMI], HbA1c), clinical (i.e., continuous glucose monitor, glucose\ntolerance test) and biological measurements (i.e., oral and fecal micro-\nbiome, plasma metabolome) were performed at pre-determined time\npoints.\nAlthough extensive inter-individual variations of glucose tolerance\nchanges were observed, each NNS intervention showed distinct longi-\ntudinal pro \ufb01les of glucose tolerance. The supplementation of saccharin\nand sucralose impaired glucose tolerance in the healthy subjects, while\naspartame and stevia showed neutral effects on glucose tolerance when\ncompared against the glucose vehicle or non-supplementation groups.\nMoreover, saccharin and sucralose signi \ufb01cantly elevated glycemic\nresponse during the intervention. Metagenomic analysis showed signif-\nicant effects of saccharin and sucralose on the gut microbiota, whereas all\nNNS had signi \ufb01cant effects on microbial functions, such as purine\nmetabolism, glycolysis, polyamine metabolism, and fatty acid biosyn-\nthesis. Based on correlations between microbial features at baseline and\nthe glycemic response at the 2nd week of intervention, signi \ufb01cant con-\ntributions of microbiome to the variation of glucose tolerance, at least for\nthe sucralose group, were revealed. A following plasma metabolomics\nanalysis identi \ufb01ed differential metabolites and corresponding enriched\npathways, which were in accordance with the correlation between mi-\ncrobial metabolic pathways and elevated glycemic response.\nTo evaluate the causal roles of the gut microbiome for glucose intol-\nerance, FMT experiments were conducted to transfer stool microbiome\nfrom top/bottom responders in each group into germ-free mice. The top\nresponders were classi \ufb01ed by the potent glycemic responses, while the\nbottom responders had the lowest responses in the respective group. Both\nstool samples from the baseline and the end of the intervention were used\nfor FMT. Impaired glycemic responses were observed in mice humanized\nwith stool samples from NNS consumption top responders (at the end of\nintervention), while the mice colonized with samples from controls did\nnot show signi \ufb01cant effects on glucose tolerance. The following meta-\ngenomic analysis in mice showed doner-speci \ufb01c variations in glycemic\nresponses. Together, it provides evidence of the causal links between\nNNS-mediated microbial alterations and glucose intolerance.\nIn summary, Suez et al. [ 22] demonstrated the individual-dependent\nimpacts of NNS on the human gut microbiome in short-term in-\nterventions and established the causal roles of the microbiome in gly-\ncemic responses by FMT. It advances our understanding of the\nmicrobiota \u2013diet interactions in the healthy population and provides the\npossibility to predict potential glycemic responses at the individual level\n[22,23]. The participants included in Suez et al. \u2019s study [ 22] were mainly\nyoung and middle-aged adults with a median age of 29.95. It will be\nparticularly interesting to study the effects of AS with a much wider range\nof age groups since the sweet taste preference and sensitivity are signif-\nicantly different between age groups [ 24]. Although no signi \ufb01cant\nbaseline differences were found between intervention groups, including\nweight, BMI, smoking, and other related clinical parameters, it is un-\nknown how subtle variance of the baseline characteristics in \ufb02uences the\neffects of AS on gut microbiota after intervention at the individual level.\nConsidering the variance of gut microbiota between individuals of\ndifferent demography, ethnicity, gender, age, dietary patterns, and life-\nstyle, a well-designed study cohort and the choices for data analysis are\nparticularly important for controlling confounding effects. In the future,\nscale-up of the study population and enriching the data collection may\nthus provide foundations for the precision control of gut microbiome.\nCurrent clinical trials examined the long-term effects of AS, showing a\nstrong association between AS and increased risk of cardiometablic disease\n[2,3,5]. However, the published studies only investigate the short-term\neffects of AS on human gut microbiota, and clinical trials investigating\nthe long-term effects of AS on human gut microbiome have not been\nperformed [ 22,24]. The \ufb01ndings in these short-term studies stronglysuggest that further explorations studying the long-term effects of AS on\nthe human gut microbiome are recommended. Moreover, most of these gut\nmicrobiota studies did not investigate the fate of AS during the interven-\ntion, and whether the in vivo AS dynamics are associated with the\nshort-term responses remains unknown. The design of clinical trials with in\nvivoAS measurements could be performed to con \ufb01rm the responses of gut\nmicrobiota to AS interventions. In addition, current studies focused on the\ngut microbiota alternations in healthy populations. The information about\nthe effects of AS on individuals \u2019gut microbiota in populations with dia-\nbetes or cardiometabolic diseases are missing. Thus, extrapolation of the\nAS effects on the gut microbiome to diabetes/cardiovascular disease pa-\ntients by controlled trials is of great interest.\nIt should be noted that AS are usually used to replace caloric sugars,\nwhich may reduce the overall caloric intake. In several clinical trials, the\ndose of AS used was lower than the acceptable daily intake with glucose\nas a bulking agent. In everyday life, AS are usually consumed together\nwith caloric sugars. Moreover, individuals may simultaneously consume\nmultiple types of AS from different foods or beverages. Therefore,\ninvestigating the effects of AS with different doses, the combination ef-\nfects of AS, or the combinations of AS with different types of carbohy-\ndrates (e.g., fructose, sucrose, \ufb01bers) would give clues of AS effects from a\nreal-life view [ 25]. In addition, AS are emerging contaminants in aquatic\nenvironments. The consequences of long-term exposure to AS with\nenvironmental concentrations are not available, which require system-\natical analysis with animal experiments, observational studies, and\ncontrolled trials.\nAlthough current clinical studies have established the causal links\nbetween AS, gut microbiota, and health, the mechanisms through which\nAS can affect gut microbiota or the human body are unknown. Since most\nnon-nutritive AS are not metabolized, whether there are direct in-\nteractions between AS and gut microbial organisms is still unclear. The\nutilization of in vitro microbial cultures and synthetic microbiota may\nprovide an ef \ufb01cient/direct way to investigate the responses of gut mi-\ncrobial species to AS. With state-of-the-art organoid methods, the intes-\ntinal organoid cocultures with microorganisms will enable the\nmechanistic study of AS-microbe-host interactions with precise experi-\nmental control.\nRecent controlled clinical trials have shown personalized responses of\nhumans to AS. Analyzing the personalized data with arti \ufb01cial intelligence\nmay provide a basis to develop computational tools for precise prediction\nof glycemic responses, which can be integrated into current weight\nmanagement algorithms for personalized suggestions of AS usage. When\nthe baseline characteristics are integrated with the gut microbiota fea-\ntures, dietary patterns, lifestyle, and medication histories, it may be\npossible to predict the metabolic dynamics of individuals and provide\nhealthy dietary nutrition recommendations, which will help control\ndiabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the future, the application of such\na personalized longitudinal multi-omics approach with arti \ufb01cial intelli-\ngence may pave the way to understanding the links between metabolic\ndisease developments and the long-term effects of AS.\nAuthor contributions\nY.J.W.: conceptualization, investigation, writing; B.B.J.: conceptual-\nization, supervision, writing.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare no con \ufb02icts of interest.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was funded the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina (No. 32111530179).
